Dr Zelenko explained: Zinc is a virus killer but to enter the cells of the virus, it needs some help. That's the job of Ivermectin which opens the gate to zinc. Also with vitamin C. VItamin D in high dose has an anti inflammatory action.
Has to be taken since the very beginning to stop the replication of the virus. 
If your doctor is not aware about the benefits, you can go on the site Push Health, Pushhealth.com, and ask for the prescription of Ivermectine (anti-viral), plus cortisone (anti inflammatory) and Azithromycin (antibiotic) and a cortison inhaler like Fluticasone. You will have to answer some questions about your health and possible allergies. The Doctor's prescription costs $65.
It's safer to have the prescription ready to start immediately Ivermectin and then to be followed by the doctor according to evolution.

PARSHAS NOACH - SHEINI WITH RASHI
Hashem tells Noach to take the animals and his family into the Teivah.

On Yud Mar-Cheshvan, 1,656 years after Hashem made the world, Hashem told Noach to come into the Teivah, together with his family, since he was the only one left who was a Tzadik.

Even though there had been a tzadik, Mesushelach, Hashem made him pass away before the mabul would start. In fact, Hashem waited an extra seven days after the Mabul was supposed to start for his kavod, so that the seven days of mourning for him would be finished before the Mabul began.

Hashem told Noach to take the animals onto the Teivah too. He should take seven pairs (one boy and one girl) of each kind of tahor animal and bird, and only one pair of each non-tahor animal and bird. He would need more of the tahor kinds, because they would be used for korbanos after the Mabul.

Noach understood which animals Hashem meant. This shows us that Noach learned Torah — that’s how he knew which animals were tahor (kosher) or not.

All of the animals came to Noach by themselves, and went into the Teivah right away. Noach put the food inside, but he didn’t go in himself yet — he didn’t have such strong emunah, and wasn’t sure Hashem would REALLY send such a dangerous Mabul. He only went in when it started to rain.

Noach was 600 years old when the Mabul started...

The Mabul started on Yud-Zayin Mar-Cheshvan. The sun, moon, and stars stopped shining, and didn’t shine again until the whole Mabul was over.

At first it just rained, to give people a last chance to do Teshuvah. But they didn’t — so Hashem made all of the water come up from underground. He also opened up the place that holds water in Shomayim, and all of the water from Shomayim poured out for forty days and nights.

Noach had gone into the Teivah during the day, with bears and lions keeping him safe from the people who wanted to hurt him! His whole family came too — his wife Naama, his sons (Sheim, Cham, and Yafes), and his three daughters-in-law. All of the animals had come too, one boy and one girl of each (and seven pairs of Kosher animals). The animals all were nice to each other on the Teivah, and none of them hurt each other — just like they will act when Moshiach comes!

Once Noach was in the Teivah, Hashem sealed the door behind him.

135 - 139
In today’s Tehillim there are some kapitelach we say during Shacharis on Shabbos. The kapitel “Hodu Lashem Ki Tov, Ki Le’olam Chasdo”, also called Hallel HaGadol (Kapitel Kuf-Lamed-Vov), is one of them. We also have Al Naharos Bavel in today’s Tehillim, which we say before bentching on a weekday.

In Hallel Hagadol, one of the things we thank Hashem for is the big lights that shine on the world — the sun, the moon, and the stars. We say, “Le’oseh Orim Gedolim, Ki Le’olam Chasdo! — Hashem makes the big lights — because His kindness is forever!”

We also thank Hashem that the sun and moon follow a seder, the sun by day and the moon by night: “Es Hashemesh Lememsheles Bayom, Es Hayareiach VeChochavim Lememshelos Balailah.”

IGERES HAKODESH SIMAN CHOF-HEY
In this letter, the Alter Rebbe is explaining to us about our Emunah in Hashem — what it means that Hashem gives chayus to the world every second. Everything a person does or says is from the chayus that Hashem gives the person at that moment — and that is not only with a Yid, but also a goy! EVERYTHING we say or do is from the chayus Hashem gives us at that moment.

Some Yidden didn’t understand how Hashem can be giving chayus to a goy every second, even if he is doing things that are trying to stop a Yid from doing a mitzvah. That is what the Alter Rebbe is explaining here.

So far we learned that the chayus Hashem gives to the world every moment is called the Shechinah. Today the Alter Rebbe teaches us about the Golus of the Shechinah. (That’s going to be the answer how Hashem can give chayus to something going against Hashem — because the Shechinah is in Golus.)

Golus means that something is not in the proper place where it is supposed to be. Like someone who is in jail — he really belongs at home but he is stuck in jail. The same thing is with the chayus of Hashem: Golus means that the chayus is not where it should be. Right after the Cheit Eitz HaDaas, the first Golus started. That’s when bad started getting mixed up into good, and it was like Hashem giving chayus to something that doesn’t really deserve it — and that’s Golus.

But that was only the beginning of Golus. Once the Yidden went into Golus, that was a complete Golus. Yidden have a Neshama which is a part of the most special chayus of Hashem, the pnimius of Hashem’s chayus! When that chayus had to become stuck in Golus, then Hashem’s most special chayus is in a place that is not proper for it to be — and that is a FULL Golus. 

Very soon, when Yidden will come out of Golus AND there won’t be any tumah or bad in the world, that will be a COMPLETE Geulah!

CHOF-CHES TISHREI
In order to get married, a Chosson gives his Kallah a ring so she will become his wife. He promises to take care of his Kallah and make sure she has what she needs.

The Yidden and Hashem are like a Chosson and Kallah! The same is with our marriage with Hashem! Hashem gave US a ring — the mitzvos, to make us His kallah. Now Hashem has to make sure we have all of the things we need to live a happy life.

When we act the way Hashem wants, Hashem promises us that He will give us everything we need, like the posuk says, “Im Bechukosai Teileichu, Venasati Gishmeichem Be’itam.”

Now that Chodesh Tishrei is ending, we are going back into the regular Gashmius’dike work to get our parnasa. We need to remember that the bracha will only come if we take care of our Ruchnius as well, by having a Kvius Itim (a set time) to learn Torah and doing mitzvos properly!

SHIUR #113 - MITZVAS ASEI #95, #92, LO SAASEI #209
Today’s mitzvah is the same as yesterday’s (Mitzvas Asei #95) — that if a Yid makes a promise and changes his mind, he needs to go to a Rav or Beis Din to do that.

We also learn two more mitzvos, from the next set of halachos in Rambam, halachos about a Nazir.

1) (Mitzvas Asei #92) A Nazir has a mitzvah to let his hair grow. Like we will see in the next mitzvah, it is asur for a Nazir to cut his hair. In this Mitzvas Asei, we learn that it’s not enough for him not to cut it, the Nazir needs to make sure he is letting his hair grow. So, for example, he isn’t allowed to rub cream on his head that keeps hair from growing.

2) (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #209) A Nazir is not allowed to cut off his hair — not even one single hair!

These mitzvos are explained in Gemara, in Mesechta Nazir.

HILCHOS NEDARIM - HILCHOS NEZIRUS
Perek Yud-Gimmel: (This is the last perek of Hilchos Nedarim.) We learn about HOW we take away a promise. At the end of the perek, the Rambam tells us when it’s a GOOD thing to make a neder. A neder can actually help us in our Avodas Hashem!

For example, if someone eats way too much, and not in an aidel way, he can make a promise not to eat any meat for one or two years. If someone drinks too much wine, he can make a neder to only drink wine on Shabbos and Yom Tov for a few years, or he can promise never to get drunk.

Still, we should be careful not to make too many nedarim, so that we don’t forget how serious a neder is in halacha. Nowadays, when we make a hachlata, we should always say that it is bli neder. Even though we are very serious about keeping our hachlata, we want to be extra careful to not ever end up chas veshalom not keeping a neder.

Now we start the next set of halachos, about a SPECIFIC kind of promise — if someone promises to become a Nazir!

Perek Alef: There are things that are asur if someone becomes a Nazir — cutting his hair or eating things made with grapes. A person doesn’t have to say “I will become a nazir” to become one — he can say things like “I will grow my hair,” while thinking that he wants to be a Nazir.

Perek Beis: We learn more about a Nazir’s promise: What happens if he makes the promise by mistake, or because someone forces him, or because of a reason that ends up not being true? In many cases, he is not a Nazir.

One interesting halacha is that a person STAYS a Nazir until they bring their korbanos, and that a Nazir needs to be in Eretz Yisroel. So if someone makes a promise to be a Nazir nowadays, he has to move to Eretz Yisroel and stay a Nazir until the Beis Hamikdash is built and he can bring his korbanos.

HILCHOS KLEI HAMIKDASH - PEREK DALED
The kohanim were chosen for the special Avodah of Korbanos, and all Yidden need to give them special Kavod. That’s why even today they get the first aliyah and other special things!

We also learn about the Mishmaros — groups of Kohanim which worked on certain days — and how EVERYONE could work during the Yomim Tovim. We learn about choosing a Kohen Gadol, and who will replace him after he passes away. We also learn how there are 8 levels of Kohanim, to make sure everything works smoothly. The higher levels are in charge of the lower levels.

MIDOS TOVOS
We will learn something from a famous sicha on Parshas Noach:

In Parshas Noach, we learn two very important things about our midos:

When the Torah tells us about the animals that went into the Teivah, it doesn’t say to bring seven pairs of kosher animals and two treife animals, it says to bring two animals that aren’t tahor. That shows us that we need to be careful to say things in the nicest way that we can. Instead of saying “tomei,” we can say “not tahor.” Instead of saying something is bad, we can say it isn’t very good.

Then there is a second lesson. When Noach drank too much wine after the Mabul (like we will see in Friday’s Chitas) he did something not good. When Shem and Yafes saw it, they went backwards to cover their father but didn’t want to see what he had done that wasn’t right. They just went to fix the problem.

The same thing is if we see people not acting the way they should. We shouldn’t think about how they aren’t acting right and think not good things about them in our mind, and of course not to say something not nice about them to others Chas Veshalom! Instead, we should just make sure to fix the problem in a kind way.

The Baal Shem Tov says that if we think too much about how another person isn’t good, and not just about fixing the person’s problem, that is a sign from Hashem that we have that not good thing in ourselves. Hashem is showing it to us like when we look in a mirror, when we really see ourselves inside.

BUILDING BITACHON IN DAVENING
What does it take for you to trust someone?

The Sefer Chovos Halevavos goes through each of the conditions a person needs in order to REALLY trust someone. As we go through the conditions, we realize that no PERSON can be completely trusted — we can only truly trust in Hashem!

The first condition for trusting someone is to know that the other person cares for us and has rachmonus on us. When we know that they love us and care for us, we will trust that they will only do things that are good for us.

It is very clear to see that we can trust Hashem in this way! Hashem has more rachmonus on us than any person in the entire world. In fact, if any person does care for us, it is only because Hashem is making him feel that way!

We speak about Hashem’s rachmonus in Pesukei Dezimra. In Ashrei, we say (in the posuk starting with Ches), “Chanun Verachum Hashem, Erech Apayim Ugedol Chased.” “Hashem is gracious and full of Rachmonus, Hashem is slow to get angry and has great kindness.”

When we say these words in davening, we can think about how Hashem truly cares for us and has rachmonus on us. This is one step that will help make our bitachon in Him stronger!

CLOSING SEFORIM
RING! Is that the bell for recess?

Before we run to get our snack, we first take care of our seforim! We close the sefer we were in the middle of using, since it is not kavodik for a sefer to be left open with nobody learning from it.

The Rebbe said that cheder kids used to ALL know this. Nowadays, people don’t always think about their seforim! They leave the room, and just leave their poor seforim open, all alone.

Once the Frierdiker Rebbe noticed an important person walking away from a table where he had been learning. His sefer was still open. In a kind way, the Frierdiker Rebbe asked him to close the sefer, and not just leave it that way.

The Rebbe had been standing nearby. The Rebbe knew how the Frierdiker Rebbe was always so careful not to bother other people, especially important people. He told the Frierdiker Rebbe that he could have asked him, the Rebbe, to close the sefer instead of telling this person!

The Frierdiker Rebbe said that it is important to make sure that the sefer is closed when it is left alone, but that is not all. It is also important that if it is possible, the person who opened it should close it himself.

[10/4/21, 7:33:51 AM] ‪+1 (347) 581‑2521‬: GEULAH U'MOSHIACH
A TASTE OF MOSHIACH
During the Mabul, all of the animals in the world were together on the Teiva.

Even though the Teiva was big, there were very many kinds of animals. It was very crowded!

Still, none of the animals fought. Snakes stayed calmly next to birds, and lions lay down next to lambs. Everything was peaceful, the way the Navi says it will be when Moshiach comes!

But when the Mabul ended, and all of the animals had to leave the Teiva, this peaceful time ended too. The lions went back to their chasing and attacking, and snakes tried to capture other animals for food again. The taste of Moshiach was over.

Even though it didn’t last very long, this time was a Nesinas Koach, something that helps us later! The fact that we already had this kind of life once makes it easier for us to bring it again, but this time in a way that will last forever!

By doing our shlichus in our part of the world, we will bring Moshiach, when we will have this kind of shalom between animals, and people too — but this time in the WHOLE world, and forever!

PARSHAS NOACH - SHLISHI WITH RASHI
In today’s Chumash, we learn about the details of the Mabul, which lasted for a complete year.

Rain fell for forty days, until the morning of Chof-Ches Kislev. This was just enough water for the Teiva to start floating, but the water was still very shallow.

Then, hot springs of water from deep under the earth opened up and filled the world with boiling water. The Teiva started drifting on the deep water, away from where Noach built it.

Even more boiling water poured out from the underground springs, until it covered all of the highest mountains! The water of the Mabul reached 15 amos above the highest mountain peak. All of the people and all of the animals that weren’t in the Teivah died, except for the fish.

Why not the fish? We learned that most of the animals had started marrying other animals, and didn’t deserve to live either. But the fish had never acted that way, so they didn’t need a fresh start after the Mabul. But how did they survive if the water was boiling hot? We know that hot water rises above cold water! The hot water of the Mabul only hurt the animals on dry land, not the fish in the cooler seas.

The water continued rising for 150 days, until the end of Iyar. Noach was lonely on the Teiva. It was very hard for him to feed all the animals in the Teivah for so long. Once he was even hit by a lion for bringing its food late! So Noach davened to Hashem for help.

Because of Noach’s tefilos, Hashem decided to have rachmonus on the world. He remembered Noach, and all of the animals on the Teivah who hadn’t done any aveiros. On Alef Sivan, the water started to go down.

Once the water went down enough, on Yud-Zayin Sivan, the Teivah rested on top of a mountain in Harei Ararat. Then, on Alef Menachem-Av, the water was low enough that you could see the tops of the mountains!

Forty days later, Noach decided to find out if it was time to come out of the Teivah. He wanted to do his Shlichus in the world already! On Yud Elul, he opened the window, and the next day he sent out the Orev bird (raven) to see if the water had dried up yet. The Orev was afraid of going all by itself. It didn’t end up going and instead just circled around and around the teiva.

On Chai Elul, Noach sent out a Yona bird (dove) to check. But the Yona came back, and Noach realized there was nowhere for it to rest. A week later, on Chof-Hey Elul, he sent it out again — and this time, it came back with an olive leaf. Noach realized that it was almost time to come off the Teivah, since there were leaves growing on trees! (The Yona picked an OLIVE leaf, which is bitter, to show Noach that it likes getting even bitter food from Hashem more than getting sweet food from a person.) Another week later, Noach sent out the Yona again — and this time it didn’t come back.

On Rosh Hashana, 1657 years after Hashem made the world, the water had cleared up. Noach saw that the earth was drying, even though it was still wet. On 27 Mar-Cheshvan, one year after the Mabul started (365 days — a solar year, not a lunar year), the world became completely dry.

The world had changed a lot during the Mabul — it became tahor and became a place where it would be much easier in the future to be able to do Teshuvah.

140 - 144
In today’s Tehillim, there is a posuk, “Tikon Tefilasi Ketores Lefanecha” — “I bring my davening before Hashem like Ketores!” (The Rambam chooses this posuk to put at the beginning of his sefer about Korbanos.)

The Rebbe teaches us that when the kohen brings the Ketores, nobody else is allowed to be there — it’s just the kohen bringing the Ketores to Hashem. The same thing is when we daven — it’s private, between us and Hashem!

Also, the word Ketores is like the word “Kesher” (in Aramaic — Ketar) — a connection. Davening is one of the ways we make a special connection with Hashem.

IGERES HAKODESH SIMAN CHOF-HEY
The Alter Rebbe is continuing to explain a certain vort from the Baal Shem Tov:

The vort from the Baal Shem Tov is that if a Goy comes to you in the middle of davening, and tries to bother you, you should realize that it’s Hashgacha Protis, and try to daven harder and with more kavanah. You should think about how Hashem is giving chayus to that Goy right now and letting him do it, and understand that Hashem is giving you a message to have MORE kavanah.

People said that it can’t be that Hashem is giving chayus to a Goy who is trying to make you mixed up in the middle of davening! How can you say that Hashem’s chayus is in a Goy like that? The Alter Rebbe explains that the chayus of Hashem IS there, but it’s in Golus.

Wherever the chayus of Hashem goes, it stays the same. But in different Olamos, Hashem is more hidden or more seen in that Olam. In some worlds the chayus of Hashem is hidden as if it was put behind a thin curtain, but in lower levels, the light of Hashem is hidden as if it was put behind a very thick curtain that blocks the light of Hashem from shining through!

Of course, the chayus of Hashem stays the same, no matter what curtains it is hiding behind!

CHOF-TES TISHREI
One time in the Baal Shem Tov’s shul in Mezibuzh, a very scary story happened:

Two people, who weren’t such good friends, were arguing with each other. One of them got so mad, he yelled at the other one, “I will rip you up like a fish!”

When the Baal Shem Tov heard this, he called his Talmidim to come. He told them to hold hands with each other, and the Baal Shem Tov himself finished their circle. Then he asked them all to close their eyes.

All of a sudden, they saw something that made them all terrified! They saw this man tearing up the other one like a fish, just like he had said!

From here we see how careful we need to be with what we say, because whatever we say will do something. Sometimes it is in Ruchniyus only, and most people can’t see it, but it ALWAYS makes something happen.

We need to be so careful to only say nice things about other people!

SHIUR #114 - MITZVAS LO SAASEI #202, #203, AND #204
Today, we learn 3 mitzvos about a Nazir:

1) (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #202) A Nazir can’t drink wine or any other drink that was made with grapes. He can’t even have wine vinegar!

We learn this mitzvah from a posuk in Parshas Naso: וְכָל מִשְׁרַת עֲנָבִים לֹא יִשְׁתֶּה

2) (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #203) A Nazir can’t eat grapes

We learn this mitzvah from other words in the same posuk: וַעֲנָבִים לַחִים ... לֹא יֹאכֵל

3) (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #204) A Nazir can’t eat raisins (because they are dried grapes!)

We also learn this mitzvah from the same posuk: וִיבֵשִׁים לֹא יֹאכֵל

In today’s Rambam, we learn more halachos about the Nazir.

Perek Gimmel: How long is a person a Nazir for? It depends — he is allowed to decide how long he wants to be a Nazir for. But if he doesn’t say how long, he is a Nazir for 30 days.

Perek Daled: At the end of being a Nazir, the Nazir needs to shave all of his hair and bring certain korbanos. When does he do these things if he made a promise to be a Nazir more than one time in a row? In this perek, the Rambam answers this question too!

Perek Hey: In this perek we learn about the three things that are Asur for a Nazir:

1) He is not allowed to eat anything that comes from grapes 
2) He is not allowed to cut his hair 
3) He is not allowed to make himself Tamei from a dead person

Today is Yom Kippur Katan. It’s like a mini Yom Kippur for the month of Tishrei! We do a Cheshbon Hanefesh to see how we did for the past month, and decide that next month, Cheshvan, will be even better!

We should also add at least a little bit in Torah, in Avodah (davening), and in Gemilus Chasadim (helping another Yid or giving extra tzedakah).

[10/5/21, 8:40:12 AM] ‪+1 (347) 581‑2521‬: LEARNING FROM THE REBBE
TOV LASHOMAYIM, TOV LABRIYOS
Today is Tuesday, Yom Shlishi.

When Hashem created the world, Yom Shlishi was an extra special day! On all of the other days, Hashem looked at what was created that day and said, “Ki Tov,” that it was good. But on Yom Shlishi, Hashem said “Ki Tov” TWO times!

The Rebbe teaches us that these two times that Hashem said it was tov, good, teach us a lesson we can think about, especially every Yom Shlishi: We should serve Hashem with TWO kinds of good — Tov LaShomayim and Tov LaBriyos.

Something that is Tov LaShomayim, good for Shomayim, is something we do for Hashem, like our learning and davening. Tov LaBriyos, good for creations, is something that helps other people, like giving tzedakah or doing Hachnosas Orchim.

We need to make sure our avodah has BOTH kinds, and we can even have them both together!

How do we have them both together?

Even when we are davening (Tov LaShomayim), we should think about other Yidden (Tov LaBriyos)! We do this right away at the beginning of davening, saying “Hareini Mekabel Alai Mitzvas Asei Shel Ve’ahavta Le’reiacha Kamocha!” And we should daven not just for ourselves, but for other people too!

And when we help another person (Tov LaBriyos), we should do it for Hashem (Tov LaShomayim)! When we are doing it for Hashem, we will help even if it doesn’t feel good. Even if the person is complaining instead of thanking us, we will help them because it is a mitzvah!

This way, we can make sure that our avodah ALL the time is done in a way of Tov LaShomayim AND Tov LaBriyos together.

BUILDING BITACHON IN DAVENING
The Sefer Chovos Halevavos has many chapters, called “She’arim” (gates). In Shaar Habitachon, it explains what a person needs to know in order to truly trust Hashem.

The second condition to have total trust in Hashem is to know that Hashem is GOOD. Hashem’s kindness is very strong, and Hashem is good to us even if we don’t deserve it. All we need to do is be a keili to accept Hashem’s brachos, and He will help us because of His rachmanus for us. We become a keili by trying to connect to Hashem and do what He wants. But the bracha that Hashem gives us is in a way of chesed, much more than we deserve!

There are many pesukim in davening that help us feel Hashem’s goodness. For example, the posuk in Ashrei that starts with a Tes: “Tov Hashem Lakol, Verachamav Al Kol Maasav.” “Hashem is good to everyone, and His rachmonus (kindness even if we don’t deserve it) is on all of His creations.”

By thinking about this, our bitachon will be stronger!

MISHNAYOS BAAL PEH
Many seforim speak about how special it is to learn Mishnayos Baal Peh. Chassidim especially have a minhag to do this!

When the Frierdiker Rebbe came to America, he started a group called “Machaneh Yisrael,” which he wanted every Yid to join. As part of this group, each member was supposed to learn a part of Mishnayos Baal Peh. This would help make the air in the world more pure!

In Tof-Shin-Gimmel, there was a big siyum on Mishnayos, from all of the Mishnayos learned baal peh by members of Machaneh Yisrael. At the siyum, the Frierdiker Rebbe said:

Once, the Rebbe Maharash was near a group of Chassidim. The Rebbe Maharash called out, “Shabbos, come here!”

The Chassidim standing around were confused. Nobody had the name “Shabbos!” Levik, Yitzchok, Yosef, Yaakov — all of those names they could understand, but who was Shabbos?

The Rebbe Maharash finally pointed at a specific chossid, and said, “You are called Shabbos!”

In Shomayim, someone who learns a Mesechta of Mishnayos by heart is called by the name of that mesechta!

The Rebbe Maharash explained that this chossid had learned Mesechta Shabbos baal peh, so in Shomayim he got the name “Shabbos!”

The Frierdiker Rebbe finished by saying, “I am learning Mesechta Menachos baal peh, so in Shomayim I am called ‘Menachos…’”

THE YONAH AND GEULAH
In this week’s Chumash, Parshas Noach, we learn the story of the Yonah, the dove that Noach sent away three times.

The main way we learn Chumash is pshat, understanding the meaning of the story the way the Torah teaches it. There are also other ways to understand the stories of the Torah. One of these is called remez, hinting.

We learn a very interesting remez from the story of the Yonah:

Yidden are compared to a dove. We are like the yonah that was sent away. We were sent into Golus. The first time, we did teshuvah and came back, rebuilding the Beis Hamikdash. Again we were sent away into Golus, again coming back ourselves to the Beis Hamikdash.

Then the yonah was sent away for the third time, and it didn’t come back. This is like us in this last Golus. We were sent away into this long and painful Golus, but we won’t come back on our own. Instead, Hashem will BRING us back, so that we can enjoy the Geulah forever and never again be sent away!

PARSHAS NOACH - REVI'I WITH RASHI
In today’s Chumash, we start to learn about what happened right after the Mabul.

Hashem told Noach that his family and all of the animals should go out of the Teivah now. On the Teivah, they weren’t allowed to have children, but now all of them will be allowed to again.

So Noach and his family, and all of the animals and birds left the Teivah. From now on, the animals would only marry the same kind.

Since Hashem asked Noach to bring 7 pairs of the kosher animals, Noach realized that Hashem wanted him to bring korbanos. Noach brought from each kind of kosher animal and bird as a Korban Olah — a korban that is all burned on the Mizbeiach.

When Hashem smelled these special korbanos, it brought Hashem a Nachas Ruach. Hashem now promised never to destroy the world again, “Ki Yetzer Leiv Ha’adam Ra MeiNe’urav” — because people are not perfect, they are born with a Yetzer Hara, and they deserve Rachmanus.

During the Mabul, aside for everything in the world being destroyed, the Mazalos in Shomayim stopped moving. The sun didn’t move, the moon didn’t move, the stars didn’t move. There was no day and night, and of course there could be no seasons!

Now Hashem said that from now on, the world will have seder. The Mazalos would start to move again, and continue forever! Every day would have a day and a night, and the seasons of the year would never stop — “Lo Yishbosu.”

Hashem tells Noach about SIX seasons! You probably only know four. The seasons Hashem says are (in order of how they happen, starting in the middle of Tishrei): Planting time (Zera), cold (Kor), winter (Choref), harvest (Kotzir), summer (Kayitz), and hot (Chom).

Hashem gave a bracha to Noach and his family, and told them, “Pru Urevu” — to have many children and fill up the earth again! They don’t need to worry that Hashem will destroy the world, because Hashem promised not to. They also don’t have to worry about the animals. During the time when people started acting in a not nice way before the Mabul, the animals stopped being afraid of people. But now they don’t have to worry about it being dangerous to live in the world, because the animals will be afraid of them again.

Before the Mabul, people weren’t allowed to eat meat. Now Hashem is allowing them to eat meat, but with certain rules:

- A person isn’t allowed to eat Eiver Min Hachai, a part of an animal or its blood before it is killed.

- A person is only allowed to kill animals, not people. A person isn’t even allowed to make himself bleed for no reason! So if an animal kills a person, it will get punished, and if a person kills another person, Hashem will make sure he is punished. A person is made Betzelem Elokim, to look like Hashem. If a person is killed, it takes away part of the Tzelem Elokim from the world, and the world looks less like Hashem. Someone who does this doesn’t deserve to live.

Hashem now gave Noach and his sons a mitzvah — “Pru Urevu!” Go have children!

145 - 150
A gutten Chodesh! Today we are saying the last six kapitelach in the entire Tehillim!

These kapitelach are all part of Davening! They are the main part of Pesukei DeZimra, which the Chachomim set up to praise Hashem.

(If you look in the beginning of the kapitel, though, you won’t see the word Ashrei! The kapitel starts with the words Tehillah Ledovid, which is the THIRD posuk in our siddur. The pesukim that start with the word Ashrei are from other kapitelach — the first one is from Kapitel Pey-Daled, and the second one is at the end of yesterday’s Tehillim, in Kapitel Kuf-Mem-Daled.)

The most important posuk in Ashrei is “Poseiach Es Yodecha Umasbia Lechol Chai Ratzon” — we say that Hashem opens His Hand and gives everyone what they need. If you don’t have kavana in this posuk during davening, you need to go back and say it again! So when you say this part of Ashrei, remember to think about how Hashem gives every living thing whatever it needs.

IGERES HAKODESH SIMAN CHOF-HEY
We are now learning how the Alter Rebbe explains a vort from the Baal Shem Tov.

The vort is that if a person is in the middle of davening, and someone comes and starts to talk to him and mix him up, he should realize that Hashem is giving him a message. He should think about how the Shechinah is in Golus inside of the words of the person who is bothering him, so that he will need to use MORE koach to have Kavana in davening!

It’s like Hashem is dressing up in a costume — it looks like something is RUINING our Kavana, but really Hashem is just trying to make our chayus in davening stronger!

If someone is falling asleep and they really need to be awake, one way you can wake them up is by taking a puppet and saying BOO! in their face. They’ll get scared and wake up. Sometimes when we daven, we are daydreaming and not really thinking about what we are saying to Hashem. So we shouldn’t get angry at whatever is bothering us, we should realize that Hashem is trying to get us to wake up and work harder to daven with Kavanah.

In today’s Tanya, the Alter Rebbe tells us that when a Yid says words of kedusha, like davening, then the Shechinah is in what he says!

Later we will learn about how the Shechinah is in Golus in the person who is bothering our davening.

LAMED TISHREI
In today’s Hayom Yom, we learn some things which are important for us to know when we say Hallel on Rosh Chodesh:

1) When we say Hallel, there are a few pesukim that end with the words “Ki Le’olam Chasdo.” After each one of the pesukim, we say the first posuk again — “Hodu LaHashem Ki Tov, Ki Le’olam Chasdo!” We do this whether we are davening with a minyan or we are davening ourselves.

2) After Hallel on Rosh Chodesh, we say a posuk “VeAvraham Zakein,” followed by a tefillah that starts with the word “Zevadiah,” three times.

SHIUR #115 - MITZVAS LO SAASEI #205, #206, #208, #207
Today we learn more mitzvos about what a Nazir is not allowed to eat:

1) (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #205) A Nazir may not eat grape seeds.

We learn this from a mitzvah in Parshas Naso: מֵחַרְצַנִּים וְעַד זָג לֹא יֹאכֵל

2) (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #206) A Nazir isn’t allowed to eat grape peels.

We learn this mitzvah from the same posuk in Parshas Naso: וְעַד זָג לֹא יֹאכֵל

We also learn 2 mitzvos about what a Nazir is not allowed to do:

1) (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #208) He is not allowed to become tamei. He can’t go on purpose into the same house as a person who passed away (Tumas Ohel).

This mitzvah is learned from another posuk in Parshas Naso: עַל נֶפֶשׁ מֵת לֹא יָבֹא

2) (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #207) He is not allowed to make himself tamei from a person who passed away (Tumas Meis).

We learn this mitzvah from the next posuk in Parshas Naso: לְאָבִיו וּלְאִמּוֹ וגו׳ לֹא יִטַּמָּא
[10/6/21, 8:30:25 AM] ‪+1 (347) 581‑2521‬: RAMBAM
HILCHOS NEZIRUS
In Rambam, we learn more halachos about what happens if a Nazir does something that is asur, and how his being a Nazir ends.

Perek Vov: If a Nazir does certain things he wasn’t supposed to, he could mess up his time of Nezirus and sometimes needs to start again!

For example, If he drinks wine or cuts some of his hair, he did something wrong, but he still stays a Nazir. If he cuts most of his hair, he needs to wait for 30 days to let his hair grow back, and then he can count from where he left off. But if he becomes Tamei from Tumas Meis, many times he will need to shave his hair and bring the korbanos, and then start being a Nazir again from the beginning.

Perek Zayin: There are some times when a Nazir SHOULD do things that a Nazir usually is not allowed to do. Like if he got Tzoraas while he was a Nazir, he has a MITZVAH to cut his hair!

Perek Ches: We learn about the things the Nazir does to finish off his time of being a Nazir, like shaving his hair and bringing certain korbanos.

HILCHOS KLEI HAMIKDASH - PEREK VOV
Really, when someone brings a korban, he needs to be there to see it. But how can ALL the Yidden be there to see the korbanos that are brought for all the Yidden, like the Korban Tomid, which is brought every day as a Korban Tzibur for all of the Yidden?

A group of Yidden who had Yiras Shomayim were chosen as the Anshei Maamad, to watch when those korbanos were brought on behalf of the rest of the Yidden. This perek tells us how these Maamados worked.
[10/6/21, 8:30:25 AM] ‪+1 (347) 581‑2521‬: INYANA D'YOMA
SHLICHUS
We will learn an important lesson about Shlichus from a sicha on Parshas Noach:

Noach got saved from the Mabul, but it wasn’t easy for him on the Teiva! Rashi brings from a Medrash that tells us that after the Mabul, Noach was groaning in pain, and spitting blood.

The Medrash tells us two reasons why Noach was in such pain.

1) Because of all of the hard work to take care of all of the animals on the Teiva.

2) Because Noach was once late in feeding a lion, and it hit him. Even though he was working so hard to feed each of the animals, Noach needed to make sure that every animal was fed on time, every time.

We can learn from this how to do better in our shlichus to help other people!

1) We need to act like Noach. We should work VERY hard to help other Yidden, even if it is uncomfortable for us, like Noach who took care of all of the animals even though it was so difficult.

2) When a person is working hard, he might feel uncomfortable. He might think that it is fine for the people he is helping to be uncomfortable too! But we learn from Noach that everyone needs to get what they need on time! We need to help other Yidden in a way that they feel happy and comfortable, and take care of the things they need right away.

MUSAF
Today is Rosh Chodesh!

In the Beis Hamikdash, extra korbanos would be brought on Rosh Chodesh. We say an additional tefillah, Musaf, for these korbanos.

In Musaf for Rosh Chodesh, we say the pesukim from the Torah that speak about the Korban Musaf for Rosh Chodesh. We ask Hashem to rebuild the Beis Hamikdash so we can again bring these korbanos, and bentch us with a good new month!

MINHAGIM FOR ROSH CHODESH
There is a very old Minhag to learn one posuk from our Kapitel Tehillim every Rosh Chodesh. We learn the posuk with Rashi (and other Meforshim too, if we want!) We learn the pesukim in order, and try to finish learning the whole Kapitel by the end of the year.

If there are exactly 12 pesukim in your kapitel (or 13 in a leap year), then it’s easy to know how much to learn: If you learn one posuk each month, you will finish exactly at the end of the year! But if there are more than 12 pesukim, you should learn a few at a time to be able to finish, and if there are less than 12 pesukim, learn the same posuk again another month.

(You can find Tehillim in English, with Rashi, online on Chabad.org!)
[10/6/21, 8:30:26 AM] ‪+1 (347) 581‑2521‬: GEULAH U'MOSHIACH
THE MABUL BEFORE MOSHIACH
The Torah tells us that in the 600th year of Noach’s life, the gates of water from the sky and fountains of water from underground opened up and started to flood the world. This was the beginning of the Mabul.

The Zohar tells us that this posuk is also hinting to another 600th year — the 600th year of the 6th millennium. At this time, we will have another kind of flood — a flood of knowledge! In the year 5600, knowledge from above (meaning the secrets of Torah that are taught from Shomayim) and knowledge from underneath (meaning understanding more about the world) will start to pour out like a fountain. This knowledge will be a preparation for Moshiach!

We see that this happened — at around this time, new knowledge came into the world “from above”: This is the time when Chassidus Chabad started to spread out! We also got new knowledge “from below” — people started learning how to use machines to make things work easier and faster.

These things are part of the “flood of knowledge” that will get the world ready for Moshiach!

Absolutely amazing! 
The Israelis do not make islands in the shape of palm trees, towering skyscrapers, expensive hotels, nor do their leaders use cars with massive  silver bodies (e.g. Dubai and the United Arab Emirates).The pride of Israel is that its technologies will be able to be used by all of humanity:
 
      Very interesting!                                                                    
 
1. Tel Aviv University is developing a nasal vaccine that will protect people from Alzheimer's and stroke.
 
2. The Technion, Institute of Technology (Haifa), has developed a simple blood test capable of detecting different types of cancer.
 
3. The Ichlov Center (Tel Aviv) isolated a protein that makes colonoscopy unnecessary to detect colon cancer, with a simple blood test.  Colon cancer kills about 500,000 people annually.
 
4. Acne doesn't kill, but does cause anxiety in teens.  The Curlight Laboratory has created a cure. Emitting UV rays at high intensity, kills the bacteria that cause acne.
  
5. The Given Imaging Laboratory has developed a tiny camera in the form of swallowed pills and transmits thousands of photos of the digestive tract.  These high-quality photos (2 per second for 8 hours) can detect polyps, cancers, and sources of bleeding.  The photos are sent to a chip that stores them and sends them to a computer.  At the end of the process, the chamber is eliminated via the rectum.
 
6. The Hebrew University (Jerusalem) developed an electrical neurostimulator (batteries) that is implanted in the chest of
Parkinson's patients, similar to the pacemaker.  The emissions from this device block the nerve signals that cause tremors.
 
7. The simple smell of a patient's breath can detect if a patient has lung cancer.  The Russell Berrie Institute for Nanotechnology has created sensors capable of sensing and registering 42 biological markers that indicate the presence of lung cancer without the need for a biopsy.
 
8. Catheterization can be dispensed with in many cases.  Endopat is a device placed between the indicator fingers, which can measure the state of the arteries and predict the possibility of a heart attack in the next 7 years.
 
9. The University of Bar Ilan studies a new drug that fights viruses through the bloodstream.  It is called Vecoy Trap, as it tricks a virus into self-destruction.  Very useful to combat hepatitis, and in the future Aids and Ebola.
 
10. Israeli scientists at Hadassah Medical Center (Jerusalem) may have discovered the first cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehring's disease, in an Orthodox rabbi.  Stephen Hawking, a famous British scientist, suffered from this disease and used methods invented by Israeli scientists to communicate.
 
You will never get this from main-stream media.

PARSHAS NOACH - CHAMISHI WITH RASHI
Hashem promises to never make a Mabul again to destroy the whole world. Hashem shows a rainbow as a sign of this promise.

Hashem had told Noach to have children, but Noach was afraid that there might be another Mabul. Even though Hashem told Noach not to worry, he was still afraid to have more children! So Hashem made a PROMISE with Noach and with everyone and every animal, never to destroy the world again. He gave Noach a sign to see that He will never do it again: A rainbow!

If Hashem sees that people need to do teshuvah, Hashem might send a storm somewhere in the world to show that there are people that DESERVE to get a Mabul. But a rainbow will shine through the clouds and Hashem will have Rachmonus and not destroy everyone.

Hashem showed Noach the rainbow so he would know what the sign looks like.

Why did Hashem choose a rainbow? A rainbow in the sky is made of light shining into a cloud with water in a certain way, that splits up the light into all of the colors. Before the Mabul, the world wasn’t able to make a rainbow — the sun couldn’t shine through the clouds, because they were too thick! But the Mabul made the world more aidel, and the clouds became more aidel too, to let the sun shine through to make rainbows. The more aidel world after the Mabul is also a world where we can do Teshuvah, which was harder to do before the Mabul! Now that it’s easier to do Teshuvah, we won’t ever NEED another Mabul!

1 - 9
Today we are starting the Sefer Tehillim again from the very beginning!

If you look in Kapitel Ches, you will see that posuk Beis and the last posuk have the same words in them! Why? Let’s see what the Gemara says about this:

When Hashem wanted to give the Torah to Yidden, the Malachim said: “You want to give such a special hidden treasure to PEOPLE?!” They said posuk beis of this Kapitel: “Hashem Adoneinu, Mah Adir Shimcha Bechol Ha’aretz, Asher Tenah Hodcha Al Hashomayim!” “Hashem, You are so great, put your Torah in Shomayim!”

Hashem told Moshe to answer the Malochim. Moshe answered, “The Torah says not to steal. Do Malochim have a Yetzer Hara that they would want to steal from each other?” After Moshe told them this and some more reasons why only Yidden can keep the Torah, the Malochim agreed.

They said this posuk again, saying how great Hashem is — but not asking Him to keep the Torah in Shomayim. They just said, “Hashem Adoneinu, Mah Adir Shimcha Bechol Ha’aretz.”

IGERES HAKODESH SIMAN CHOF-HEY
This letter from the Alter Rebbe explains something we learn from the Baal Shem Tov: If a person is the middle of davening, and someone tries to get him mixed up, he should think about how the Shechinah is in Golus inside of the one who is bothering him. The Shechinah goes into Golus in that person who is getting chayus from kelipah, in order to give MORE chayus to kedusha, by the person using this challenge to add more Kavana in his davening.

The Alter Rebbe explains this vort, by teaching us how Hashem Echad Ushmo Echad — Hashem is one. The same Hashem that is giving chayus to the Yid who is davening, is also giving chayus to the Goy who is trying to get him mixed up. Hashem just made the chayus easier to see in the Yid who is davening, and more hidden and in Golus in the Goy who is bothering him.

It’s like the chayus of Hashem is dressing up in a costume — it looks like something is RUINING our Kavana, but really Hashem is doing this to make our chayus in davening stronger! So we shouldn’t get angry at whatever is bothering us, we should realize that Hashem is making this happen to wake us up, and work harder to daven with more Kavanah.

Yesterday we learned that the Shechinah is inside of the words of our davening.

Today the Alter Rebbe tells us that the Shechinah is also inside of the goy who is trying to bother us! But there, the Shechinah is in Golus.

Hashem wanted there to be two kinds of chayus in the world — one that helps us act the way Hashem wants, and one that is a challenge — that makes it hard for us to do it. The first kind of chayus is in our neshama, and it helps us do what we need to! But why do we need the second kind of chayus? To add more chayus into kedusha, by us using the challenge to add more in Avodas Hashem!

Hashem is ready for that chayus to be in Golus, to make sure we will work hard with the strongest kochos of our neshama. That chayus is in the goy who bothers us in davening.

ALEF MAR-CHESHVAN
In today’s Hayom Yom, we learn about something called Sod Habirurim, the secret of the Birurim.

What are Birurim?

All around the world, there are little pieces of kedusha stuck all over in different places. These pieces of kedusha are called Nitzutzos. When we use the opportunities we have to serve Hashem, wherever we are, then we are able to set those nitzutzos free!

Every person has a special shlichus from Hashem to free some of the Nitzutzos that are hidden and stuck.

But how do we know where to find our Nitzutzos?

This Sod Habirurim started with Avraham Avinu. Hashem told him to go far away from where he lived, to another place. There were Nitzutzos waiting for him there!

How can we find OUR Nitzutzos, since Hashem doesn’t tell us where to go?

Certain big Tzadikim know where their shlichus is, and they go there themselves — otherwise only Hashem knows! But we don’t have to worry! Hashem makes things happen Behashgacha Protis so we will end up in the right place to find our Nitzutzos and set them free.

The Rebbe Rashab said this to a melamed who moved from the Vilna area to a town in Cherson to have a job:

This melamed once came to the Rebbe Rashab in yechidus. The Rebbe Rashab asked him if there is a shiur Chassidus every day where he lives. He answered that the Balebatim have a shiur on Shabbos, but since they don’t really like to learn Chassidus they don’t have a shiur every day.

The Rebbe Rashab told him: Do you think you moved to your town just so that you can be a Melamed? Hashem could have given you students where you lived before, and you would have a job as a Melamed there!

Did you think about the fact that Hashem sent you there for a reason?

Then the Rebbe Rashab told him the message of today’s Hayom Yom, that Hashem makes every person end up where they are with a special shlichus they need to accomplish.

SHIUR #116 - MITZVAS ASEI #93, #114
We learn one last mitzvah about a Nazir:

1) (Mitzvas Asei #93) When a person finishes his time of being a Nazir, he has to shave off his hair and bring korbanos.

The Rambam learns this mitzvah from a posuk in Parshas Naso: בְּיוֹם מְלֹאת יְמֵי נִזְרוֹ

We also learn one mitzvah from the next set of halachos:

2) (Mitzvas Asei #114) If a person promises to give Hashem as much money as a certain person is worth, he needs to follow what it says in the Torah about how much money to give.

We learn this mitzvah from a posuk in Parshas Bechukosai: אִישׁ כִּי יַפְלִא נֶדֶר בְּעֶרְכְּךָ נְפָשֹׁת וגו׳

HILCHOS NEZIRUS - ERCHIN V'CHARAMIN
In Rambam, we finish learning about the Nazir:

Perek Tes: At the end of a person’s Nezirus, he has to bring certain korbanos. The money that is set aside to pay for them, and the animals that he brings, get a special kedusha! So if he set aside too much money for his korbanos, the money has kedusha and can’t be used for other things.

Perek Yud: This is the last perek about the halachos of a Nazir.

There are three times a Nazir might need to shave his hair:

1) At the end of his Nezirus — Tiglachas Tahara
2) If he became tomei in the middle, he shaves all of his hair when he becomes tahor — Tiglachas Tumah
3) If he becomes tamei from Tzoraas during the time he is a Nazir

The Rambam tells us what happens if he has all three, or if there is a sofek that he might have them — how and when he needs to shave his hair and bring his korbanos.

At the end of this perek, the Rambam tells us that a person who becomes a Nazir for the right reason is very special to Hashem!

We now start a new set of Halachos — Hilchos Erchin VaCharamin — when a person promises to make a donation to Hashem (to help pay for keeping the Beis Hamikdash running). We learn how to find out how much a person is worth, or a field, or other kinds of things. This is also a kind of Neder (promise) — which is what this Sefer of Rambam (Hafla’ah) is all about! This is a kind of promise called Nidrei Hekdesh.

Perek Alef: The Rambam discusses the din of Erkei Adam, the worth of a person. The Rambam tells us from the Chumash how much money to give for each person based on if they are a man or a woman, and how old they are. There is also another kind of neder where we figure out how much someone is worth depending on how much people would pay for them if they were sold as a slave.

CHODESH CHESHVAN
In a farbrengen at the beginning of Cheshvan, the Rebbe spoke about this special month:

We just finished a very exciting month with many special Yomim Tovim.

But now that it’s all over, what is there to look forward to? We are back at school and our regular schedule, and it can feel boring.

Well, that’s what Chodesh Cheshvan (which today is its Rosh Chodesh), is all about. Of course having mitzvos that are exciting and fun is important, and Hashem wants us to have them. But being a Yid isn’t just during the times that are exciting. Hashem wants us to show how a Yid acts the way he should even on a regular day when there isn’t anything exciting happening. We don’t get a chance to show that until the month of Cheshvan.

Hashem said to the month of Cheshvan that when Moshiach comes it will get a special thing! What is it?

The Chanukas Beis Hamikdash Hashlishi will be in the month of Cheshvan!

And when we show how a Yid acts even when nothing exciting happens, we make that VERY exciting thing happen much sooner!

BUILDING BITACHON THROUGH DAVENING
We know we need to always trust in Hashem, but sometimes it is hard to feel it!

Like we see in Tanya, a good way to make ourselves feel something is to understand it and think about it — then we will start to feel that way too.

To feel our bitachon in Hashem, we can think about how much it makes sense to trust in Hashem, and how it doesn’t make sense to trust in a person!

The Sefer Chovos Halevavos, in the section Shaar HaBitachon, explains the reasons why a person would trust in someone else. The Chovos Halevavos shows us how these reasons are only really true with Hashem!

One reason we might trust someone is because he cares about us and wants to help us. We trust our parents, our teachers, and our friends. We know that they are looking to make sure things are good for us.

But there is one problem: Sometimes a person is trying to help, but he doesn’t know what we really need!

Let’s say my uncle sees me having a hard time with my report. He tells me, “I see that this report is really too hard for you. I will speak to your teacher about it, and in the meantime, you don’t have to finish the report.” Of course, I trust my uncle! He cares about me and wants me to do well in school. I don’t work on the report anymore, I work on something else instead.

But my uncle is just a person! He might not know what is REALLY good for me. Maybe it would be better for me to get used to doing things even when they are hard. Maybe there is another reason why I should continue working on the report. Maybe I will get in trouble for not finishing the report, even if my uncle does speak to the teacher.

I can trust that my uncle wants to help... but I can’t trust that his help will always be what I need!

Hashem is different. Not only does Hashem care about us and want good things for us, Hashem knows exactly what every one of us needs!

When we think about this, it makes a lot of sense to have bitachon in Hashem. Hashem loves us very much. We can trust that Hashem knows what is REALLY good for us, and will give us exactly what we need.

During davening is a very good time to work on our bitachon! The Rebbe told many people that if they make their bitachon in Hashem stronger, it will help bring more of Hashem’s brachos into their lives.

The words of Pesukei Dezimra can help us think about why we should trust Hashem.

One of the pesukim in Pesukei Dezimra that help us think about how Hashem knows just what we need is, “Einei Chol Eilecha Yesabeiru, Ve’ata Nosein Lahem Es Achlam Be’ito.” “Everyone’s eyes turn to You, Hashem, and You give them their food at the right time.” Hashem knows just what each of us needs, and gives it to us just at the right time.

YAALEH VEYAVO
On Rosh Chodesh, we add Yaaleh Veyavo in Shemoneh Esrei. We ask Hashem for the special brachos of the day!

If we accidentally leave it out in the Shemoneh Esrei of Shacharis or Mincha, we might have to say Shemoneh Esrei again! It depends when we realize we missed it:

1) Vesechezenah: If we were in the middle of Vesechezenah, before saying the bracha, we go back to Yaaleh Veyavo and say Vesechezenah again afterwards.

2) After Vesechezenah: If we already said Hashem’s name in the bracha at the end of Vesechezenah (Hamachzir Shechinaso Letzion), we say Yaaleh Veyavo right there, and then go straight onto Modim.

3) Modim: If we already started Modim, and we remembered before finishing Shemoneh Esrei, we go back to Retzei (the paragraph BEFORE Yaaleh Veyavo), and then say those paragraphs again.

4) End of Shemoneh Esrei: If we already said the second Yihiyu Leratzon (the one after we say our name posuk, right before Oseh Shalom), we need to go back to the beginning of Shemoneh Esrei.

RAINBOWS
There are two reasons why Hashem brings rainbows.

The first one is what we learned in today’s Chumash, Chamishi of Parshas Noach, to show that Hashem will never bring another Mabul to destroy the world. Rainbows that come from this reason are not a happy sign — they are a sign that people really need to do teshuvah, and Hashem needs to have Rachmanus on them so they won’t be punished.

The Zohar also tells us another, much happier, reason why Hashem sends rainbows: The Zohar says that when it’s time for the Yidden to come out of Golus, a rainbow with bright colors will appear in the sky. When you see that rainbow, you should hope for Moshiach!

See Zohar parshas Noach 72b and Sefer Hasichos 5752 p. 66 ha’arah 100

PARSHAS NOACH - SHISHI WITH RASHI
After the Mabul was over, the world needed to fill up again with people and animals. We start to learn about the children Noach had, and the nations from them that filled up the world. We also learn a story that happened not long after Noach left the Teivah.

We learned in the beginning of the parsha that Noach was a Tzadik Bedorosav, a tzadik in his time. One of the ways Rashi explains this is that Noach was a tzadik compared to everyone else who lived then, but not everything he did was the way a tzadik of nowadays should behave.

Noach should have realized what an important job he had now. The world would need to get filled up again with people and plants and animals. They would need to plant food, raise animals, and build cities!

But, the Torah tells us, “Vayachel Noach” — Noach made himself “chulin,” free to relax. Instead of planting wheat, Noach planted grapes first. When the grapes were ready, he made wine and drank much more than he should have.

In fact, Noach got so drunk that he hardly knew what he was doing. He finally fell asleep in his tent, and wasn’t even tznius’dik.

Canaan, the son of Cham, came into Noach’s tent. He saw his grandfather lying that way, and told his father. Cham came in too, and instead of covering up his father Noach, he excitedly told his brothers to come look.

Shem and Yafes were not excited to hear about this. They were upset at what Cham did! Together, they brought a blanket, and walked in backwards so they could cover up their father without looking at him when he wasn’t tznius’dik.

When Noach woke up, he realized what happened. He gave a curse to Canaan, the son of Cham, saying that his family would be slaves to the children of Shem.

He gave brachos to Shem (that the Yidden would come from him), and to Yafes (that his family should become very rich).

We start to learn about the 70 nations that came from Noach. We learn everyone’s names, and a little bit about some of them. For example, Nimrod tried to fight against Hashem (Mored, like Nimrod), and Peleg was in the time of the Dor Haflagah (like Peleg), the generation that got spread out all over the world.

Today’s shiur Tehillim is kapitelach Yud through Yud-Zayin.

Before Dovid Hamelech became king, he was forced to run away from his enemies.

Some people said to him then that he must have done aveiros, because he was suffering so much! In Kapitel Yud-Alef, Dovid Hamelech says that this is not true — this was a test, not a punishment. “Hashem Tzadik Yivchan,” Hashem tests a tzadik!

In fact, a test is sometimes what SHOWS that someone is a tzadik!

Rashi says on this posuk that we can see an example of this from how linen is made. For the threads to be very soft, the stalks of flax need to be beaten. But if the flax is not good quality, it can’t be hit as hard, because the stalks will break. The same thing is with a person: Only a tzadik, who is strong, can have these kinds of hard tests from Hashem!

Dovid Hamelech said that the same was true here: Hashem knows the truth, that he didn’t do the aveiros people were blaming him for, and the reason he was being chased was because it was a test from Hashem.

IGERES HAKODESH SIMAN CHOF-HEY
Today the Alter Rebbe finishes explaining the vort of the Baal Shem Tov that we’ve been learning over the last few days, about what to do if someone is bothering you during davening.

But first we review about what to do if anything at all is bothering you, from someone or something else that can make you angry, so that we will see what the vort of the Baal Shem Tov is talking about.

There are three KINDS of things that can make a person angry:

1. Something happened that you don’t like. For that we learned before what the Chachomim say, that we need to make our emunah stronger so that we remember that it is B’Hashgacha Protis. Hashem made it happen and we should think about that — not about the cause, the person who did it.

2. Someone said or did something that is an aveira and you can stop it. Then it’s Hashgacha Protis but you need to say or do something to stop it. The Alter Rebbe tells us a story from the Torah where Moshe became angry to stop Yidden from doing something they shouldn’t have been doing.

3. Someone is doing something wrong but there isn’t anything you can do about it. For example, you are doing Mivtzoyim at a fair, and you stop to daven Mincha. All of a sudden, a band starts playing loud goyishe music. This is the type of case the Baal Shem Tov’s vort is talking about! You know it’s Hashgacha Protis, but even though you can’t stop the music, there is still something you still need to do!

You need to think about what we learned earlier, that Hashem’s Shechinah is in Golus in the people singing the goyishe music. Hashem is making you hear it because He wants you to concentrate harder on the davening. Then you will have used out this opportunity Hashem sent to you in the right way!

BEIS MAR-CHESHVAN
The Rebbe Rashab once said in a sicha the following story:

A little while after the Alter Rebbe became Rebbe, he said to the chassidim, “Men Badarf Leben Mit Der Tzeit!” — “we need to live with the time!” Chassidim wondered what this could mean. The Alter Rebbe’s brother, R’ Yehuda Leib (called the Maharil) was told what this meant and the older chassidim found out from him.

The “time” that the Alter Rebbe was talking about was the parsha of the week. And “living with the time” means that we shouldn’t just LEARN the parsha every day (like we do in Chitas), but we need to LIVE with it. We should be thinking about it all the time, and learning lessons for what to do now from the parsha of the week and the Chumash of each day!

In later years, the Rebbe taught that we should also “Live with the times” with the other shiurim of Chitas that we learn every day, and especially the shiur in Rambam!

SHIUR #117 - MITZVAS ASEI #115, #116, #117
In Sefer Hamitzvos, we learn about three of the many kinds of presents a person can give to the Beis Hamikdash. The mitzvah is to follow the halachos if we give these kinds of presents.

We learn all of these mitzvos from pesukim in Parshas Bechukosai:

1) (Mitzvas Asei #115) If someone gives a non-kosher animal (like a horse), or an animal that has a mum and can’t be brought as a korban, he needs to follow the halachos of how it can be given as a present.

The words of the Torah we learn this from are: וְהֶעֱמִיד אֶת הַבְּהֵמָה לִפְנֵי הַכֹּהֵן וְהֶעֱרִיךְ הַכֹּהֵן אֹתָהּ

We learn the details of this mitzvah in Mesechta Temurah and Me’ilah.

2) (Mitzvas Asei #116) If someone promises to give a house to the Beis Hamikdash he has to follow the halachos of how this present is given.

We learn this from the words: וְאִישׁ כִּי יַקְדִּשׁ אֶת בֵּיתוֹ קֹדֶשׁ לַה׳ וְהֶעֱרִיכוֹ הַכֹּהֵן

The Gemara explains the details of this mitzvah and the next one in Mesechta Erkim.

3) (Mitzvas Asei #117) If someone promises to give a field to the Beis Hamikdash he has to keep the halachos of how to give it as a present.

We learn this mitzvah from the words: וְאִם מִשְּׂדֵה אֲחֻזָּתוֹ וגו׳ וְאִם אֶת שְׂדֵה מִקְנָתוֹ אֲשֶׁר לֹא מִשְּׂדֵה אֲחֻזָּתוֹ וגו׳

We learn the halachos about this mitzvah in today’s Rambam; we will IY”H learn about houses and animals in tomorrow’s Rambam.

HILCHOS ERCHIN V'CHARAMIN
In Rambam, we are learning more halachos about someone who promises to make a donation to the Beis Hamikdash, as much as someone is worth. We also start learning the halachos about if someone donates a field.

Perek Beis: We learn about someone who says they want to give as much as PART of a person is worth (like his arms), or how much a person weighs. At the end of the perek, we learn halachos of different rooms in the Beis Hamikdash that were used for different kinds of donations.

Perek Gimmel: What if I promised to give as much as my baby brother is worth to the Beis Hamikdash — and didn’t actually give it until my brother was older? Do I give as much as a baby is worth, or how much a kid is worth? The Rambam teaches us that the amount is based on when he made the promise to give, not when the Beis Din wants to take it. We also learn what happens if someone can’t afford to give the donation in the end, or if his present was lost or stolen. Sometimes the Beis Din needs to take his things instead of his money.

Perek Daled: Now we learn the halachos of someone donating his field to the Beis Hamikdash. There are two kinds of fields — a Sedei Achuzah that someone got as a yerusha (like after his parents passed away) or a Sedei Mikna that a person bought or got from hefker.

HILCHOS KLEI HAMIKDASH - PEREK CHES
Now we learn about the clothes of the kohanim. The clothes had to be perfectly neat and clean — otherwise their Avodah was no good!

The Rambam teaches us about the materials they were made of, and where they were kept. The clothes the Kohen Gadol wore on Yom Kippur were only worn ONCE, and then they had to be buried! The clothes of the kohanim wouldn’t get washed — once they got dirty, they were made into wicks.

In the Beis Hamikdash, they had a very organized way to store all the clothes!

MIDOS TOVOS
In today’s Chumash (Shishi of Parshas Noach), we learn an important lesson in Ahavas Yisroel and having good midos:

When Noach drank too much wine after the Mabul he was not behaving the right way. When Shem and Yafes saw this, they went backwards to cover their father. They didn’t want to see what he had done that wasn’t right, they just went to fix the problem.

The same thing is if we see people not acting the way they should. We shouldn’t think about how they aren’t acting right and think not good things about them in our mind, and of course not to say something not nice about them to others Chas Veshalom! Instead, we should just make sure to fix the problem in a kind way.

The Baal Shem Tov says that Hashem uses another person as a mirror for us! When we look in a mirror, we see ourselves. If our face is clean, we don’t see anything dirty in the mirror. If we see dirt in the mirror, it is because OUR face is dirty!

If we think too much about how another person isn’t good, and not just about fixing the person’s problem, that is a sign that we have that not good thing in ourselves.

Imagine if we see someone doing something that could hurt someone else. We might think, “What a terrible kind of person! He doesn’t care about other people! Look at what he is doing!” We aren’t thinking about how to help him be more careful, we’re just upset at him. Really, we should realize that he is a mirror for us! Maybe WE need to be more careful about not hurting other people.

When a tzadik looks at another person, because he doesn’t have any Ra inside of himself, he doesn’t see Ra in another person! If he sees a problem, he doesn’t think about how awful the other person is, he just thinks about how he can help the person become better.

So instead of getting angry about what another person is doing, we should try to help them in a nice way if we can, and work on fixing up the things that need to be corrected in OURSELVES!

MAKING BITACHON STRONGER THROUGH DAVENING
Having bitachon makes our connection with Hashem strong. The Rebbe reminded many people in letters that having stronger bitachon opens up a path for more brachos to come from Hashem!

Sometimes it can be hard to feel our bitachon.

Something that can help is to learn and think about how much having bitachon in Hashem makes sense! When we understand it, we will then start to feel that way too.

When we fly in an airplane, we trust the pilot of the plane. We know that the pilot proved that he is able to fly such a big plane safely and land it in the right place. We can trust him since he is able to do it!

Knowing that someone is ABLE to take care of something helps us trust him.

But people are just people. We trust the pilot to fly our plane, but that doesn’t mean we will trust him as our dentist! We can trust him to do specific things, but we can’t trust him in EVERYTHING.

Bitachon in Hashem is different!

We CAN trust in Hashem for everything. Hashem is able to do anything!

When we think about this, our bitachon in Hashem will be stronger!

One place to think about this is in davening. In the praises of Hashem in Pesukei Dezimra, we speak about how Hashem has the koach to make anything happen. For example, the paragraph “Halelu Es Hashem Min HaShomayim” speaks about how all of the creations praise Hashem and that Hashem is in control of everything in the world.

BUYING FROM YIDDEN
In Parshas Behar, the Torah teaches us about doing business like a Yid should. One of the pesukim has the words, “Konoi Miyad Amisecha,” “when you buy from your fellow.”

The Chachomim learn from this posuk that if a person has a choice, he should buy from a Yid.

Many years ago, there was a terrible terrorist attack in Kfar Chabad. After this attack, the Rebbe sent a group of bochurim to raise the spirits of the Chassidim and Yidden of Eretz Yisroel. The Rebbe made sure that the tickets for these bochurim were bought from a Jewish airline, based on this halacha.

The Rebbe writes about these airline tickets in this letter of 5716

FINISHING IT UP
At the end of this week’s parsha, Parshas Noach, we learn the ten generations from Noach until Avraham Avinu.

In Pirkei Avos, it says that Avraham Avinu got the sechar for all of those generations! He got the reward for all of them because he tried to fix up the not-good things that they did. He found the Nitzutzos of kedusha that got stuck because of their aveiros, and brought them up to kedusha. Many of those generations were resha’im, but with Avraham Avinu’s chesed, he davened for them too and asked Hashem to forgive them.

In this way, Avraham Avinu was able to finish the job of all of those ten generations that came before him.

We are in the last generation of Golus! Like Avraham Avinu, we also need to fix up the Nitzutzos of kedusha that got stuck here, and bring them up to kedusha. We do this by following the example of Avraham Avinu, of chesed and Ahavas Yisroel, to be mekarev everyone with love to Yiddishkeit. This way, we will not only be rewarded for what we do now, but also from the previous generations!

We will be finishing the job of all of the generations that came before us, and bringing the complete and final Geulah!

PARSHAS LECH LECHA - RISHON WITH RASHI
Hashem tells Avram “Lech Lecha” — to go to Eretz Yisroel and get many brachos there, and he goes. There is a famine there and he needs to leave Eretz Yisroel and go down to Mitzrayim. He tells Sarai to hide.

Hashem spoke to Avram for the first time when he was 75 years old. (Hashem gives the name Avraham later, but now the Torah calls him by his original name, Avram.) He told him “Lech Lecha! You already went with your father away from where you were born, to Charan (as we learned in the end of last week’s parsha). Now, go even further away, and leave your father, Terach. Go to the land that I will show you.”

(Even though Terach believed in Hashem, he pretended to do Avodah Zarah because he didn’t want other people to know. Hashem wanted Avraham to go away from that.)

Hashem didn’t tell Avram where, for two reasons. The trip would be harder and he would get an extra reward for the mitzvah, but also the end would be more exciting and special. This would make him love Eretz Yisroel even more!

Hashem promised Avram many brachos for going there, and said he would be happy and understand that it is good. This is what Lech Lecha means, “go for yourself” — it will be good for you too!

Here are some of the brachos Avram would get:
- He would go away from the Avodah Zarah in Charan
- He would have children, even though where he is now, he can’t have children
- A big nation would come from him
- He would become rich
- Even though he is going to a new place, he would become famous, so he can teach more people about Hashem
- He would have the koach to give other people brachos
- He would become one of the Avos that would be mentioned in Shemoneh Esrei, and the bracha would even be ended with his name (“Baruch Ata Hashem, Mogein Avraham”)
- Everyone who gives him a bracha will get a bracha — and the opposite too
- People will give brachos by saying “You should be like Avraham!”

Avram went, like Hashem told him. He took his wife, Sarai (later her name would become Sarah), and his nephew Lot came too. Avram followed Hashem’s directions, and they came to Eretz Yisroel (which was called Canaan at that time).

Avram stopped in Shechem (which is also called Elon Moreh). There, he davened for Shimon and Levi who would later fight with Shechem, and Hashem also showed him Har Grizim and Har Eival there, where the Yidden would promise to follow the Torah when they came into Eretz Yisrael.

Avram saw that the Canaanim were capturing Eretz Yisroel then, from the children of Shem. Hashem appeared to Avram in a nevuah and promised that He would give Eretz Yisroel back to his children, the Yidden, who are from Shem!

Avram built a Mizbeiach to thank Hashem for the two promises he just got — that he would have children, and that they would get Eretz Yisroel!

Then they went further, and traveled past Beis-Keil. When they got between Beis-Keil and a place called Ai, Avram set up the tents. First he set up his wife’s tent, out of kavod for her, and then set up his own tent. Then he built another Mizbeiach. Avram had a nevuah that someone would do an aveira here and the Yidden would be in danger, so he davened for them. (The danger happened in the time of Yehoshua, with a man named Achan).

Avram kept going closer and closer to the place where the Beis Hamikdash would be built!

That year, there was a famine in Eretz Yisroel (food didn’t grow, so there was nothing to eat). Hashem made this famine only in Eretz Yisroel, to test Avram. Would he doubt Hashem’s words, that Hashem told him to come to Eretz Canaan and now he is already forced to leave?

He decided to go to Mitzrayim in the meantime, since there was no famine there.

On the way, Avram saw Sarai in the water, like a mirror. Usually, he didn’t think so much about how pretty she was, but now he realized that people would think she was VERY beautiful! He was afraid that the Egyptians would want to kill him and take her away to get married to her. So he told Sarai to hide in a box, and that if they find her, she should say that she is Avram’s sister, so they won’t kill him. They will instead try to be nice to Avram, and give presents so they can take her. This would be a keili for Hashem’s bracha that he would become rich.

23 - 28
In today’s Tehillim, we have a kapitel that is the Shir Shel Yom of every Sunday, Yom Rishon!

Some of the pesukim in this kapitel talk about the time when Shlomo Hamelech went to bring the Aron into the Kodesh Hakodoshim in the Beis Hamikdash. He asked the gates to open up, “Se’u She’arim Rosheichem.” Just like in a song sometimes you sing parts twice, these words are said twice in this Kapitel.

The Metzudas Dovid, who explains the meaning of pesukim in Nach (it is said that the Rebbeim especially liked his pirush), says that it is also a hint: The two times it says “Se’u She’arim Rosheichem” hint to the two times that the Shechinah rested in the Beis Hamikdash — the first Beis Hamikdash, and in the third Beis Hamikdash. (Because in the second Beis Hamikdash, Hashem’s Shechinah wasn’t there as much as it was in the first, or as much as it will be in the third.)

IGERES HAKODESH SIMAN CHOF-VOV
In this letter, the Alter Rebbe will explain to us the difference between Torah learning during Golus, and Torah learning when Moshiach comes, based on the words of the Zohar. To understand this, we will also learn many more special things about learning Torah and about the times of Moshiach!

The Alter Rebbe bases his words on a part of the Zohar called the Raya Mehemna, in Parshas Naso.

The Zohar is talking about what is going to happen before Moshiach comes. In Sefer Daniel it says that many people will be tested to show what a person really is like inside. The Zohar says that this is only for people who taste from the Eitz Hadaas, the people that only learn Niglah. But people who taste from the Eitz Hachaim, who learn the Zohar and Pnimius HaTorah, won’t need to be tested. That’s because the Eitz Hachaim has the koach of teshuvah in it.

The Zohar is speaking about the difference between Niglah and Pnimius HaTorah. It seems to say that Niglah of Torah is connected to the Eitz Hadaas, which has tov (good) and ra (not good), but Pnimius HaTorah is the Eitz Hachaim which doesn’t have any ra. That’s why, with the koach of Pnimius HaTorah, Yidden will be able to go out of Golus.

But how can this make sense? How can we say that any part of Torah has ra, not good? There are clear pesukim and quotes from our Chachomim that say the exact opposite! They all say that the WHOLE Torah is called an Eitz Chaim, not just Pnimius HaTorah! And so many of our Chachomim and great tzadikim lived before the time that Pnimius HaTorah was allowed to be learned by everyone, and they only learned Niglah! Only years later did the Arizal say that it was now a mitzvah to spread Pnimius HaTorah! Even the Rashbi himself spent most of his years in the cave learning Niglah! The whole Zohar wouldn’t have taken him more than two or three months to say!

Obviously, it can’t be that this is what the Zohar is saying! The Alter Rebbe will explain to us what the Zohar really means. By the end of the letter, we will understand what incredible things happen when we learn Torah now in Golus, and how the purpose of our learning will change when Moshiach comes.

A person shouldn’t think that if he has a set time to learn Torah, it’s his own business; and even if he doesn’t, it doesn’t hurt anyone. Today we learn that isn’t true!

Learning Torah makes an atmosphere at home. It brings the feeling of Torah and Yiras Shomayim in the house!

Learning isn’t just for yourself, it is for the whole family — that it should feel like a Yiddishe home!

SHIUR #119 - MITZVAS LO SAASEI #111, #215
Today we are learning the last perek in Sefer Hafla’ah, and starting a new Sefer in Rambam, called Sefer Zera’im! In this new sefer, we will learn all about the mitzvos of planting!

We learn one last mitzvah about Cherem (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #111): That a person is not allowed to change his mind about a field he made into Cherem. He cannot decide instead to redeem it by giving as much as it is worth, like he can if he promises his field to the Beis Hamikdash. If he gives his field in a way of plain Cherem, the actual field goes to the kohen and he can’t redeem it.

We learn this mitzvah from Parshas Bechukosai: לֹא יִמָּכֵר וְלֹא יִגָּאֵל

(Mitzvas Lo Saasei #215): We also learn a mitzvah about Kilayim, mixing seeds: In Eretz Yisroel, we aren’t allowed to plant two kinds of seeds together.

We learn this mitzvah from Parshas Kedoshim: שָׂדְךָ לֹא תִזְרַע כִּלְאָיִם

The details are explained in Mesechta Kilayim.

HILCHOS ERCHIN V'CHARAMIN - HILCHOS KELA'IM
In Rambam, we learn the rest of the halachos about donations to the Beis Hamikdash.

Perek Ches: On Tes-Vov Adar (Shushan Purim), the Beis Din checks on the donations they got all year for the Beis Hamikdash and puts the money together with the Machtzis Hashekel they just collected, so it will be ready to use for all of the things the Beis Hamikdash will need. All of the things that were given need to be sold, because the Beis Hamikdash will only use the money!

Mazel Tov! We just finished learning Sefer Hafla’ah! Now we start learning the next sefer, Sefer Zera’im, which begins with the halachos of Kilayim:

Perek Alef: We learn about two kinds of Kilayim, things we are not allowed to mix. There are Kilai Zeraim, different kinds of seeds or plants which are not allowed to be planted together, and Kilai Ilanos, different kinds of trees that are not allowed to be forced to grow into one tree.

The mitzvah of Kilai Zeraim is only in Eretz Yisrael, but Kilai Ilanos, forcing two kinds of trees to grow into one tree, is asur everywhere. But even though we can’t GROW those kind of trees, we ARE allowed to eat fruit that grew from them!

Perek Beis: What happens if someone realizes that his field was by mistake planted with different kinds of seeds? How can he fix it? There are many halachos about what to do!

Every year, the Beis Din reminds everyone to check their fields to make sure there is no Kilayim. On Tes-Vov Adar (like with Erkin), the Beis Din comes around to check everyone’s fields!

HILCHOS KLEI HAMIKDASH - PEREK YUD
We learn how the clothes of the kohanim are put on. They have to be put on in a special order — first the pants, then the shirt, then the belt, then the hat. The Kohen Gadol needs to put on the me’il, the efod, and the choshen, then the hat and the tzitz. We learn about making sure there are exactly the right number of clothes, and what we do when the Urim Vetumim doesn’t light up to tell an answer from Hashem.

LEARNING TORAH EVERY DAY
Today’s Hayom Yom the Rebbe took from a letter the Frierdiker Rebbe sent to a person who said he had no time to learn Torah. The Frierdiker Rebbe told him that “Ra Hadavar Me’od Me’od” — this is very, very bad! A person NEEDS to have a set time to learn Torah every single day!

1) It is very important for Gashmius: As we learned in the Hayom Yom of Chof-Ches Tishrei, Hashem gives us the Gashmius we need BECAUSE we learn Torah — “Im Bechukosai Teileichu… Venasati Gishmeichem Be’itam!”

2) It is very important for Ruchnius: Of course we need to learn Torah to know how to keep the mitzvos, and also because Hashem created the world and put neshamos of Yidden there to learn Torah. But besides for that, we need to learn Torah because it gives our neshama the kochos it needs to do its shlichus in the world! It is like food for the neshama!

3) It is important for every person in the family: As we see in today’s Hayom Yom, the father learning Torah makes a difference for everyone in the family! It makes the home have an atmosphere of Torah and Yiras Shomayim.

The Frierdiker Rebbe told this person that if until now he has been busy 12 hours a day with business, from now on he should be busy for 14 hours — to learn Torah at least 2 hours every day! The Frierdiker Rebbe gives him a bracha that Hashem should help him find plenty of parnasa, easily.

BUILDING BITACHON THROUGH DAVENING
Bitachon is part of the way we connect to Hashem.

One of the main times we make that connection with Hashem stronger is during davening. We spend time thinking about and working on our love, fear, and trust in Hashem.

We think about things that help us realize how much it makes sense to trust in Hashem. This way, we will feel it too!

One thing we think about is to realize that nothing in the world has any koach of its own. Everything is from Hashem!

When we understand this, we won’t be scared of anything! Nothing in the world can do anything to us unless Hashem wants it to. We also don’t need to trust in anyone or anything else — they can only help us if Hashem wants them to!

One of the places we can think about this is in Pesukei Dezimra. One of the pesukim we say is, “Al Tivtechu Bindivim, Beven Adam She’ain Lo Seshuah.” “Don’t trust in donors, in a person who doesn’t really have help.” His help isn’t HIS! It is Hashem helping you, through that person! We realize that it only makes sense to trust in Hashem.

THE FACE OF THE SHECHINAH
In the Zohar Chadash for Parshas Lech Lecha, it says something very beautiful: When the Rashbi (Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai) would go to see kinderlach learning Torah, he would say that he was going to see the face of the Shechinah!

This isn’t just a nice saying. The sefer Kav Hayashar says that a melamed of Jewish children needs to keep this in mind. He should remember that the Shechinah is with them when they are learning, and he should be careful to do his work properly! He should also make sure that the room where he is teaching is clean and kavodik (respectful) for the Shechinah!

Poskim say that a classroom where children learn Torah has halachos similar to a shul or Beis Medrash, that it needs to be kept clean and treated with respect!

LECH LECHA - A STEP UP
The name of this week’s parsha is Lech Lecha. “Lech” means to go!

In the parsha we see how Avraham goes and does what Hashem is asking him to, coming closer B’Gashmius to where Hashem wanted him to go, and B’Ruchnius coming closer to Hashem. Wherever he goes, he is doing his shlichus to teach everyone about Hashem!

But some parts of the parsha don’t exactly seem like Avraham is moving forward! Right when Avraham comes to Eretz Yisroel, there is a hunger and he needs to leave Eretz Yisroel and go down to Mitzrayim. There, Sarah is captured and taken to Paraoh’s palace. Does that sound like going UP in kedusha or going DOWN?

Really, this IS all part of Lech Lecha, going forward! These things that happened were part of Avraham Avinu’s tests. As Avraham passed each of these tests, he became even closer to Hashem! And because of going down to Mitzrayim, he became rich and famous, making it easier to do his shlichus in a much better way. So even these “down” things are all part of going up!

The same thing is with Golus and Geulah. We are trying to go forward, up towards Geulah. But many of the things that happen in Golus seem to look like we are being shlepped even further from the Geulah, chas veshalom! Instead of things getting better, they sometimes look like they are getting worse.

But just like with Parshas Lech Lecha, these “down” times are all part of going up higher! These hard “down” parts of Golus are part of getting closer to Moshiach! It doesn’t always feel that way, but the truth is that the Golus itself is what brings the Geulah!

PARSHAS LECH LECHA - SHEINI WITH RASHI
In today’s Chumash, we learn what happened when Avram and Sarai were in Mitzrayim.

When Avram came to Mitzrayim, Sarai was hiding in a big box. The officers at the border of Mitzrayim told him he has to open the box so they can see what is inside. When they saw Sarai, they decided that she was so beautiful, she should get married to Paraoh — so they took her away to Paraoh’s palace.

Sarai said that she was Avram’s sister, like Avram had asked her too. The Egyptians gave Avram a lot of presents, to make him happy to let his sister be Paraoh’s wife.

Sarai didn’t want to be married to the goyishe king Paraoh, of course! Hashem made everyone in Paraoh’s palace get a very bad rash that hurt a lot. This way he wouldn’t be able to even touch Sarai! Paraoh STILL tried, but Hashem gave Sarai a malach that she could ask to hit Paraoh any time he tried to come too close to her.

Paraoh realized that Sarai must be married to Avram, since all of these things were happening.

He called Avram to come, and asked, “Why didn’t you tell me you were married to her? Why did you say she is your sister? Now you got me in trouble with Hashem!

“Go out of Mitzrayim, since people here aren’t good people and will try to steal Sarai since she is so beautiful.”

Paraoh sent guards to go with Avram when he went out of Mitzrayim. He also sent his daughter, Hagar, to be a servant to Sarai. He decided that it was better for her to even be a servant in the house of a Tzadeikes who Hashem loves, than to be a princess!

Avram went back on his way to Eretz Yisroel, on the same road as before. (He felt that it was mentchlich to stay in the same places he did before, and he wanted to pass by the same places to pay back anyone he owed money to.) He went back to Beis-Keil, where he first brought a korban to Hashem, and davened there again.

29 - 34
Today’s Tehillim is kapitelach Chof-Tes to Lamed-Daled.

The Frierdiker Rebbe once told this story:

Once when the Mitteler Rebbe was 7 or 8, he davened for a longer time than usual — he davened “BaArichus.” After he finished davening, someone asked him what took him so long! The Mitteler Rebbe answered that he stopped to think about something that is says in davening, and that made it take a long time.

Which part? It was a posuk from today’s Tehillim — Kapitel Lamed (posuk gimmel)! We say this kapitel every day before Boruch She’amar.

“Hashem Elokai, Shivati Eilecha Vatirpa’eini” — “I cried out to You, Hashem, and You made me feel better!”

The Mitteler Rebbe was thinking about the word “Vatirpa’eini” (“and You healed me”). He was thinking how that word is like the word “rifyon” — making something weaker; so the posuk could mean “I cried out to You, Hashem, and You made my Yetzer Hara not as strong!” He was thinking about how Hashem helps us win over our Yetzer Hara!

Very soon, when Moshiach comes, Hashem will take away our Yetzer Hara completely! We will have won the fight with the Yetzer Hara!

Until then, Hashem helps us make it weaker so we will act the way Hashem wants us to.

IGERES HAKODESH SIMAN CHOF-VOV
In this Igeres Hakodesh, the Alter Rebbe is explaining a Raya Mehemna (a part of the Zohar) in Parshas Naso, which tells us what is special about learning Pnimius HaTorah, and the difference between our learning in the time of Golus and the time of Geulah.

A person who learns this Zohar might at first think that the Zohar is saying that when Moshiach will come, we will not learn Niglah anymore — we will only learn Pnimius HaTorah.

The Alter Rebbe shows us that this is not at all what the Zohar means! Here are two reasons why:

1) In the Gemara, many times it says “Teiku” — that we don’t understand certain halachos, but Eliyahu Hanavi will explain them when Moshiach comes! If Eliyahu Hanavi is explaining them, of course we will learn them!

2) The things we learn about in these halachos are things we will still be doing when Moshiach comes! We will still be eating fleishigs, and will need to know all of the halachos about shechting meat.

HEY MAR-CHESHVAN
Way back in the olden days, there was no such thing as street signs or GPS. If someone didn’t know the way, they would have to ask other people or use the sun to know which direction they were going in. But what did they do at night?

The stars in the sky might look like one big pile of dots, but really if you look carefully, you can see that they are constellations — patterns or groups of stars that you can find in the sky every night! People used to use the constellations like a compass to figure out which way they were going. So even on a very dark night, with no street signs, a person could look up at the sky and see which direction they should go and wouldn’t get lost.

The world can sometimes be a very dark and confusing place. People get busy with things that aren’t important and don’t realize what they should be doing.

Yidden are compared to stars! Each one of us has the koach to shine as a Dugma Chaya. Our good example shows other people the way they should act and how to follow the path of Torah and mitzvos.

Yidden are like stars that help others not get lost in the darkness of Golus.

In Rambam, we learn more about Kilayim.

Perek Gimmel: We aren’t allowed to plant different kinds of plants together. Does that mean we can’t plant purple carrots next to orange carrots? No! That’s okay because they are both carrots. In this perek, we learn what “different kinds” means. We also learn how close to each other they need to be in order to be called growing “together.” If it’s easy to see that they aren’t being planted together, like if there is a mechitzah, or they are in different fields, that’s not called kilayim.

Perek Daled: What do we need to do if we want to plant two kinds together in the same field? Sometimes they need to be far enough apart that they can’t join into one plant, and sometimes they need to LOOK like they are separate.

Perek Hey: In this perek and the next four perakim, we will learn about Kilei HaKerem. The Torah is very strict about not planting other things together with grapes! Even outside of Eretz Yisroel we need to be careful with this mitzvah. We learn about how long the plant needs to be there, and how much it needs to grow, for it to be asur.

The Rebbe teaches us that a Chossid is someone who doesn’t just daven and learn like a chossid, but someone who talks and plays with their friends like a chossid, who eats and drinks and walks around like a chossid! They speak to other people the way a chossid should, with eidelkeit, and sensitivity to others. Only when we live ALL THE TIME the way Chassidus teaches us, can we really be Chassidim.

STRENGTHENING BITACHON THROUGH DAVENING
What does it mean to have bitachon?

To be SURE and secure, trusting that someone will take care of you.

In order to have bitachon in Hashem, we need to make sure that our Emunah in Hashem is complete. This way we will KNOW that we can trust Hashem.

The Chovos Halevavos tells us seven parts of having proper Emunah, which will help us have proper Bitachon:

1) Hashem has so much Rachmonus! Hashem is the source of all Rachmonus. If someone else has Rachmonus on us, it comes from Hashem’s Rachmonus too.

2) Hashem is good! Hashem is truly good, and Hashem wants us to have good too — even if we’re not perfect.

3) Hashem knows what is good for us! Hashem made us, and Hashem understands us. Hashem knows exactly what we really need!

4) Hashem can do it! Other people might WANT to help us, but only Hashem truly can, no matter what. Nothing can stop Hashem from helping us if Hashem wants to!

5) Hashgacha Protis! Hashem knows about and cares about every single detail of our life. Whatever Hashem does is good for EVERY detail.

6) Hashem is in charge! Nothing and nobody can hurt or help us unless Hashem wants it to!

7) Hashem is the real reason! Everything happens the way it does because that is how Hashem wants it to be! All the things we see and think are the reason are just causes in this world to make them happen.

By thinking about these things when we praise Hashem in Pesukei Dezimra, our emunah and bitachon will be stronger!

Even when Hashem’s name is just written, it has a special kedusha. If there is a paper with Hashem’s name on it, we treat it with kavod, and don’t throw it away. It becomes “Shaimos” (meaning “names”).

According to many Acharonim, this isn’t just for Hashem’s name written in Lashon Kodesh. If we write out Hashem’s name in ANY language, that also has kedusha!

Because of this, we are careful not to write Hashem’s name completely, even in English. We write “G-d” so that we don’t have Hashem’s full name written down.

MOSHIACH'DIKE DAVENING
When we are davening, we need to think about the basic meaning of what we are saying. In Shemoneh Esrei, we say, “Vesechezenah Eineinu Beshuvcha Letzion,” “Our eyes should see the return to Yerushalayim.” We also say, “Es Tzemach Dovid Avdecha Meheira Satzmiach,” “The plant of Dovid Hamelech (Moshiach, who comes from Dovid) should quickly grow.”

Then, we will ask ourselves a question: “What did I do TODAY to make this happen?”

Does anyone have a spare apartment/ or is anyone going away for a few months and willing to rent out your place to a great newlywed couple? I know the market is on fire right now which is why I ask here :) feel free to private message me.

PARSHAS LECH LECHA - SHLISHI WITH RASHI
Lot became very rich because he went with Avram. He had lots and lots of animals and tents.

In fact, he had so many animals, that between Avram’s animals and Lot’s animals, there weren’t enough grassy fields where they lived for all of the animals to eat!

Avram’s shepherds knew to only let the sheep and cows eat from grass that didn’t belong to anyone, but Lot’s shepherds gave the animals food even from other people’s fields! They thought that Eretz Yisroel belonged to Avram already, and since Avram didn’t have anyone to pass it down to except for Lot, they thought they could take any part of Eretz Yisroel already.

Avram’s shepherds argued with them, because taking grass from someone else’s fields is stealing! The Torah tells us that the shepherds of Lot were wrong — the land didn’t belong to Avram yet either, and the Canaani and Perizi lived there.

Avram didn’t want to be in a fight with his nephew, so he told him to maybe move a little bit further away, so that each of them have their own space. He promised to stay close by so he could always help him if he needed it. (As we will see later, that actually happened.)

Lot saw that Sedom and Amora had plenty of water, so things grew well there. It had lots of beautiful trees, like Gan Eden, where Adam Harishon lived when he was first created. It had lots of plants growing, like in Mitzrayim. Lot also saw that the people acted in not very tznius’dike ways, and he liked that too.

So Lot decided to move there, and also to move away from the way Avram served Hashem.

The people in the area were very not nice. They did aveiros on purpose, just to make Hashem angry. But Lot didn’t mind living with them anyway...

In the meantime, now that Lot moved away, Hashem spoke to Avram again. He promised him again that Eretz Yisroel would belong to his children, the Yidden. Hashem told Avram to look all over Eretz Yisroel, in all directions, and it would all belong to him.

Avram continued to travel through Eretz Yisroel, until he reached Chevron, where he built a Mizbeiach to thank Hashem.

In the first Maamar the Rebbe said, Bosi Legani, he explains a posuk from today’s Tehillim: “Tzadikim Yirshu Aretz Veyishkenu La’ad Aleha.” “Tzadikim get ‘aretz’ (Gan Eden), because they make Hashem rest (Veyishkenu) in the world.”

In the maamar, the Rebbe tells us that this is OUR special shlichus too — to bring Hashem’s Shechinah into the world to rest here, which will bring the Geulah! We do this through having Ahavas Yisroel and acting in a way of Shtus D’Kedusha.

IGERES HAKODESH SIMAN CHOF-VOV
The Alter Rebbe is explaining a piece in the Zohar which seems to be saying that the halachos of Torah are mixed with good and bad, and that we won’t learn them when Moshiach comes. The Alter Rebbe told us that this can’t be right, and today explains to us the right way to understand it.

The Alter Rebbe explains that the THINGS that the Torah talks about are mixed with good and bad (Eitz HaDaas Tov VaRa). When Moshiach comes, the not good part of it won’t be there anymore. But the HALACHOS themselves, the way they are in Torah, are FOR SURE always only from Kedusha (Eitz HaChaim)!

All of the Gashmius’dike things in the world come from kelipah. Many of them come from a kind of kelipah called Kelipas Noga, which has a mixture of good and bad. You can choose to use it for kedusha (if you do a mitzvah with it) or Chas Veshalom a person could use it for not good things. (It’s a little bit like pareve food — if you cook it with milchigs it becomes milchig; if you cook it with fleishig it becomes fleishig.)

But the HALACHOS, even the halachos ABOUT tumah, are all part of Torah Shebaal Peh, which the Zohar says very clearly is a VERY high level of kedusha.

VOV MAR-CHESHVAN
Once a Chossid of the Alter Rebbe, named R’ Yekusiel Liepler, was in Yechidus.

The Alter Rebbe wanted to give him a bracha to be rich, but R’ Yekusiel said he didn’t want that bracha! He said that it would take too much time to take care of the money, and he only wanted to learn Chassidus and serve Hashem.

Then the Alter Rebbe wanted to give him another bracha — that he live for a long time (Arichas Yomim). R’ Yekusiel said he only wanted the bracha if they were not “poierishe yoren” (peasant years) — he said it’s only worth living if he lives like a chossid, knowing about and serving Hashem.

In a sicha, the Rebbe asks, “How can it be that when a person gets a present, especially such a special one like a bracha for long life, that he says he only wants it IF he gets certain conditions?” The Rebbe explains that R’ Yekusiel wasn’t making a condition. He just wanted to say that for him, it’s only a bracha if he lives like a chossid. He didn’t feel that any other way of living is real life.

SHIUR #121 - MITZVAS LO SAASEI #217, #218
In today’s Sefer Hamitzvos, we learn two mitzvos about not mixing ANIMALS together:

1) (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #217) We aren’t allowed to make two different kinds of animals get married to each other, like a cow with a sheep.

We learn this mitzvah from a posuk in Parshas Kedoshim: בְּהֶמְתְּךָ לֹא תַרְבִּיעַ כִּלְאַיִם

The details are explained in Mesechta Kilayim perek Ches

2) (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #218) We are not allowed to make two different kinds of animals shlep a plow or a wagon together.

We learn this mitzvah from a posuk in Parshas Ki Seitzei: לֹא תַחֲרשׁ בְּשׁוֹר וּבַחֲמֹר יַחְדָּו

The details are explained in Mesechta Kilayim perek Ches

We learn the halachos of these two mitzvos in tomorrow’s Rambam.

HILCHOS KELA'IM
In Rambam, we finish learning about Kilai HaKerem, not growing any other kind of plant together with grapes.

Perek Vov: We learn how much of the grapes become asur if they are planted close to vegetables. We also learn about mavrich, when a person makes the grapevine go underground and come up in a different place. Can we plant something else in that in-between space?

Perek Zayin: We learn what is considered a Kerem (vineyard) according to halacha, and what is considered just a single vine, which is less strict than a full Kerem.

Perek Ches: There are two ways to grow grapes: Letting the vines grow on the ground, or draping the vines over a wall, a fence, or an arch. Letting them grow on the ground is the regular way we grow grapes. When the vines are hanging over something else, called Aris, there are different halachos.

We also learn that the halachos are a little different outside of Eretz Yisroel.

A kohen is not allowed to go into the Kodesh without a good reason, and the Kohen Gadol is not allowed to go into the Kodesh Hakodoshim except on Yom Kippur to do the Avodah. We also learn what happens if a kohen is an avel, mourning for someone.

MODEH ANI
In today’s Hayom Yom, we learned what R’ Yekusiel Liepler told the Alter Rebbe: That for him, Arichas Yomim, long life, only counts as life if he feels Elokus.

The truth is that all of us, when we say Modeh Ani in the morning, say the same thing! Why do we say Modeh Ani? Because every night, our neshama goes up to Shomayim and Hashem holds onto it.

In the morning we thank Hashem for giving us back our neshama. What do we say? We don’t just say thank you for giving us A neshama, for giving chayus. We say thank You for giving me MY neshama — the neshama of a Yid (not a Goy or an animal)!

This shows that we’re not just thanking Hashem for being alive — because then we could just say thank You for giving us chayus! Instead, we say “Shehechezarta Bi Nishmasi,” that Hashem gave us our neshama — because for a Yid, a life without our Yiddishe neshama isn’t really life.

STRENGTHENING OUR BITACHON THROUGH DAVENING
We have been learning about how the time of davening is a good time to make our bitachon in Hashem stronger.

In every Yid’s neshama, there is emunah in Hashem. A Yid believes that Hashem loves and cares for him, and is able to help him in everything he needs. But for us to feel it in a way that we will trust in Hashem and have bitachon because of it, we need to think about it. We learned about things we can think about during Pesukei Dezimra that will help make our bitachon stronger.

But that’s not ALL we need to have complete bitachon.

It doesn’t make sense to rely on Hashem and at the same time go against what Hashem says! Even though Hashem doesn’t expect us to be perfect, and with His chesed gives more than we deserve, we still need to try our best to do what Hashem wants from us.

A good place to strengthen this is in Kriyas Shema and the brachos before. In the brachos before Shema, we wake up our Ahava to Hashem so we will want to serve Hashem, and in Shema we say that we take upon ourselves Ol Malchus Shomayim, that we are ready to serve Hashem the best we can!

This way, we can have a much stronger bitachon in Hashem, so that when we stand before Hashem during Shemoneh Esrei, “Ke’avda Kamei Marei,” like a servant before his master, we will be sure that Hashem will give us all we need.

B"H ON LETTERS
When you ask a Yid how he is feeling, what does he answer? Boruch Hashem!

Yidden are always thinking about Hashem, and are used to mentioning Hashem’s name often.

It is a minhag by Yidden that when we write something, we first mention Hashem. We write Boruch Hashem (B”H), Besiyata Dishmaya (BS”D), or something else like this.

We even do this on papers that have nothing to do with Torah. That’s because, really, the WHOLE world is full of the kavod of Hashem! There is nothing that doesn’t have to do with Hashem and His Torah. By writing B”H or BS”D on a letter, we are reminding ourselves how EVERYTHING is connected to Hashem!

MACH DOH ERETZ YISROEL!
We learn in Parshas Lech Lecha that Hashem promised Eretz Yisroel to Avraham’s children, the Yidden! Since then, every Yid feels connected to Eretz Yisroel and wants to be there.

A Chossid once came to the Tzemach Tzedek. He said that he very much wants to go to Eretz Yisroel.

The Tzemach Tzedek answered him, “Eretz Yisroel isn’t missing for R’ Hillel Paritcher, but it is for you!? Make this place into Eretz Yisroel — Mach Doh Eretz Yisroel!”

This chossid badly wanted to go to Eretz Yisroel. He could work on making his own place more like Eretz Yisroel, but he still won’t be getting what he wanted! So how did the Tzemach Tzedek’s answer help him?

The Rebbe explains that when Moshiach comes, the kedusha of Eretz Yisroel will spread out to the whole world! Part of our job in Golus is to get the world ready for this! When we work on making our part of the world into Eretz Yisroel by bringing in Elokus, we are getting it ready for Moshiach.

Now we can’t see that it is Eretz Yisroel, but when Moshiach comes we will see how our part of the world will change with the kedusha of Eretz Yisroel!

Other parts of the world will only really become Eretz Yisroel when Moshiach comes. But even now, when we prepare it for the way it will be when Moshiach comes, by learning Torah and doing mitzvos wherever we are, it starts to get the kedusha of Eretz Yisroel, which will be complete when Moshiach comes!

So by doing the avodah of “Mach Doh Eretz Yisroel,” the Tzemach Tzedek’s chossid really WAS starting to live —at least in Ruchnius — in Eretz Yisroel!

PARSHAS LECH LECHA - REVI'I WITH RASHI
In today’s Chumash, we learn how Avram wins over four very strong kings to save his nephew Lot!

Kedarlaomer, the king of Elam, ruled over the lands of five other kings (Bera from Sedom, Birsha from Amora, Shinav, Shemever, and the king of Bela). For twelve years these five kings allowed Kedarlaomer to rule over them, and then they didn’t want to be ruled! So for thirteen years, they rebelled, not listening to Kedarlaomer anymore.

The fourteenth year of their not listening was the same year Avram came to Canaan. That year, Kedarlaomer had enough! He asked three of his friends, Amrafel, Aryoch, and Sidal, to join with him in Emek Hasidim and fight the five rebelling kings. (Emek Hasidim, the valley of the Sidim, later filled with water and became the Yam Hamelach.)

First, they went to capture more lands. They won over the Refaim, the Zuzim, and the Eimim! They won even over all of the giants there, and the only giant left was Og. They also won over the Chori people, they captured the land that would later belong to Amalek, and they won over the Emori.

Then the five kings that had stopped listening to Kedarlaomer came to Emek Hasidim to fight. The four kings won this war also.

The five kings had to run away! When the king of Sedom was running, he fell into a big hole full of clay. Even though a person usually would sink inside and not be able to live, he was okay! Hashem did this to show the nations that nisim can happen, and now they would believe that Avram was saved from the fiery furnace by a neis also.

Everyone else ran away to the mountains to hide.

Now the group of four kings took everything they wanted from Sedom and Amorah. They also took Lot, who lived there.

Og, who survived the war, ran and told Avram that his nephew was captured. Avram decided that he needs to fight these four kings to save Lot! So Avram made Eliezer, his main servant and student, his general! Avram wasn’t afraid to make a war with the four kings, even though they were so strong and won so many wars before.

Avram won the war with them, and set Lot free and got all of his things back.

When Avram came back, the king of Sedom came out to greet him. All of the people who survived the war called him the prince of Hashem!

Shem (who is also called Malki-Tzedek), the king in Yerushalayim, also came and blessed Avram. Avram knew that there were many leaders of Avodah Zarah, but Shem was the only leader (kohen) of serving Hashem! To show kavod for Hashem, Avram gave Shem maaser from everything he had.

The Rebbe explains that this posuk is saying that for a person to really be close to Hashem, we need to be crying for Hashem ALL the time. We shouldn’t want to be close to Hashem just on Shabbos or only when we’re davening, but even when we’re eating or playing on a regular weekday!

IGERES HAKODESH SIMAN CHOF-VOV
Yesterday, we said that even though the halachos of the Torah are very holy, still the Torah is called the “Eitz HaDaas Tov VaRa” — “the tree of knowledge, with good and bad.” This is because the things that the halachos talk ABOUT have not good in them.

Today the Alter Rebbe explains that even though the Torah itself is from Malchus D’Atzilus, a very high level in Ruchnius, it puts on the “clothes” of lower levels when it goes there. Since the Gashmius of the world is mixed with good and bad, it makes it look like Torah is mixed with good and bad too.

Really, the source of Torah doesn’t have these things! But for us to understand it, the Torah needs to wear this kind of “clothing.” The Torah comes down to this world in a way we can understand it, so we can connect to Hashem by learning Torah.

ZAYIN MAR-CHESHVAN
Many people think that to become close to Hashem and live the way a Yid should, we should first think about how the Torah is the right way to live, and how good it is. Then we should discuss it with other people too. After that, we can start to do the mitzvos and live that way.

That USED to be the way to do it, but not anymore!

Avraham Avinu, when he was a very young boy, thought about how Hashem must be the One Who created the world, and that people need to act the way Hashem wants. Then he went and taught about Hashem to everyone in the world!

Finally, he had a Bris Milah. He did a mitzvah in Gashmius so his body would be connected to Hashem!

But after Hashem gave us the Torah, doing the mitzvah itself comes first. That’s why now we do the opposite order: First we do a Bris Milah, and only afterwards do we learn Torah, and only then do we think about why we do it, and how the Torah is the true way a Yid needs to live.

SHIUR #122 - MITZVAS LO SAASEI #42, ASEI #120, LO SAASEI #210
Today we learn one last mitzvah about Kilayim, things we can’t mix together. Today’s mitzvah is about Kilayim in clothes!

Shatnez: (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #42) We are not allowed to wear clothes made of wool and linen mixed together. This is called shatnez.

We learn this mitzvah from a posuk in Parshas Ki Seitzei: לֹא תִלְבַּשׁ שַׁעַטְנֵז

The details are explained in Mesechta Kilayim, Mesechta Shabbos, and the end of Mesechta Makos.

We are starting a new part of Rambam now, about what we give to the poor. We learn 2 mitzvos about this today, about the part of our fields we leave for the poor, called Pe’ah:

1) (Mitzvas Asei #120) It is a mitzvah to leave over a corner of our fields or orchards for the poor people to take food from there.

We learn this mitzvah from a posuk in Parshas Kedoshim: תַּעֲזֹב אֹתָם

The details are explained in Mesechta Pe’ah.

2) (Mitzvas Lo Saasei #210) It is asur to NOT leave over that corner!

We learn this mitzvah from a posuk in Parshas Emor: לֹא תְכַלֶּה פְּאַת שָׂדְךָ בְּקֻצְרֶךָ

The details are explained in Mesechta Pe’ah.

HILCHOS KELA'IM - MATNOS ANIYIM
In today’s Rambam, we learn the last halachos of Kilayim, and start the halachos of Matnos Aniyim.

Perek Tes: We are not allowed to force different kinds of animals to get married to each other. We can only help sheep to get married to sheep and have baby sheep! We don’t have them get married to goats and have baby… shoats?

We are not allowed to make two kinds of animals work together to pull a wagon or other piece of farm equipment. It is asur to even sit in a wagon pulled by two kinds of animals, because that makes them shlep it! But a PERSON is allowed to help an animal pull a wagon!

Perek Yud: In this perek, we learn the halachos of Kilayim in clothing — shatnez. Shatnez means mixing wool and linen together. Any way we mix them — by sewing them together, making a kind of material with wool and linen, or even just sewing one thread of wool into linen — are all asur! But it IS okay to wear a linen belt over wool clothes, because they are not connected.

Shatnez isn’t just for clothes — if it can touch your skin and make you warm, it is also asur! So sheets, towels, and soft squishy couches also can’t have shatnez.

Now we start the halachos about Matnos Aniyim, what we need to give to poor people. We will be learning 13 mitzvos about this, in 10 perakim.

Perek Alef: In this perek, the Rambam tells us about the five gifts that a person has to give to the poor from the things he grows. They are called Pe’ah, Leket, Peret, Olelos, and Shichecha. We will learn them over the next few days in Sefer Hamitzvos and Rambam.

The Chachomim say that a person should leave over 1/60th of his field or orchard as Pe’ah, but if a person was bentched with more than he expected, he should give more. The more you give, the more reward you get!

HILCHOS BIYAS HAMIKDASH - PEREK GIMMEL
People who are tamei are not allowed to come into the Beis Hamikdash. One halacha is that if a person who is tamei comes in by climbing over the roof, or in a box flying in the air, he doesn’t get Kareis, but he does get Makas Mardus — malkos from the Beis Din.

AHAVAS YISROEL
In the times of the Beis Hamikdash, all of the Yidden had to travel to Yerushalayim to be Oleh Regel for Sukkos.

The Yidden didn’t start asking for rain until the last Yid got back home from Yerushalayim. That could take a long time — from Sukkos until today, Zayin Cheshvan!

Even nowadays, the Yidden in Eretz Yisroel don’t start asking for rain (Vesein Tal Umatar Livracha) until today!

(Outside of Eretz Yisroel, we wait until the time rain was needed in Bavel — this year, it will be Ohr L’Chof Kislev.)

The Rebbe tells us that we can learn a very big lesson in Ahavas Yisroel from this! Really, ALL of the Yidden in Eretz Yisroel needed rain right away for plants to grow. Only a few people who lived very far from Yerushalayim had such a long way to travel that they wouldn’t get home until today. Still, ALL the Yidden waited to ask for what they needed, so that even these last few people could get home from Yerushalayim easily, without having to go through a rainy and muddy path. This shows us how much we need to care about the pain of even one Yid, because all Yidden are really one.

When things happen to us, we can usually point to a reason why. Maybe someone wasn’t being careful, or the pencil broke, or there was a lot of traffic because of construction.

But none of those things are the REAL reason.

The true reason for EVERYTHING is because that is what Hashem decided should happen!

All those things that we think are the reasons are just the tools Hashem uses to make things work out that way.

We can understand this a little better by looking at an example:

If someone plants a tiny little apple seed, do you know what can grow? A great big apple tree with hundreds of fruit, each with many seeds of its own! Does that make sense?

No! The main thing is that Hashem wants that tree to grow. Planting the seed is just a tool Hashem gave us to get it started.

When we think about this and start to feel it, we will have more bitachon! We will understand that it is HASHEM Who will take care of us and give us what we need. We don’t need to worry about the traffic, the neighbors, or our school supplies. Those things don’t have any koach on their own. They aren’t the reasons at all! Nothing will happen unless Hashem wants it to.

One of the places we can think about this is in the tefillah of Vayevarech Dovid, in Pesukei Dezimra. We say, “Beyadcha Koach U’Gevurah, U’veyadcha Legadel Ul’chazeik Lakol.” “Koach and strength are in Your hands, and it is in Your hands to bring growth and strengthen everyone.” We say that it is Hashem Who makes everything happen!

KIDDUSH LEVANA
It is our minhag that Lechat’chila the first day we say Kiddush Levana is on Yom Zayin of the month.

The Rema writes that we dance and celebrate at Kiddush Levana the way we celebrate at a chasunah! Kiddush Levana is a sign for the Geulah of Yidden, when there will be the chasunah between Yidden and Hashem!

One of the last horaos we got from the Rebbe, in 5752, is to be extra careful with Kiddush Levana. We are careful to do it properly, at the right time, and if possible, we do it in a beautiful way — wearing nice clothing and together with other people!

MOONS AND MOSHIACH
The Gemara says that when a person does Kiddush Levana at the right time, it is like he is greeting the Shechinah!

What does Kiddush Levana have to do with greeting the Shechinah?

During Golus, we are not zoche to greet the Shechinah. But every month, when the moon begins to grow large again, we are reminded that Yidden will also become great again when Moshiach comes. Then we will be able to greet the Shechinah!

That is why one of the things we say in Kiddush Levana is “Dovid Melech Yisroel Chai Vekayam!” The kingdom of Dovid Hamelech is compared to the moon. Like the moon, Dovid Hamelech’s melucha will grow great again — when Moshiach comes!
